                         Apache Tomcat 6.0 Patch Proposals
                         =================================


RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:


PATCHES ACCEPTED TO BACKPORT:
  [ start all new proposals below, under PATCHES PROPOSED. ]

PATCHES PROPOSED TO BACKPORT:
  [ New proposals should be added at the end of the list ]

* Fix issue where the first request for a deleted JSPs returns as if the JSP
  still exists.
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=683969
  +1: markt, funkman
   0: remm (looks risky, very minor problem), fhanik - minor problem
  -1: 

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=45403
  See commit message for details of negligable performance impact
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=701358&view=rev
  +1: markt, funkman
  -0: remm (I also do not think the patch is a good idea as a backport)
  -0: fhanik - the bug talks about WEB-INF/lib and reload, that would be when reload="true" which should be considered development only
      So to make this bug actually worth while fixing, and not impact performance, then it should only do this check on files that 
      are relevant to the reload of an application, in other words a watched resource

* Backport cleanup of semantics of thisAccessedTime and
  lastAccessedTime for sessions:
  - preparational whitespace changes
    http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=711695&view=rev
  - Give thisAccessedTime and lastAccessedTime for sessions
    a clear semantics:
    http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=711711&view=rev
    - thisAccessedTime will be updated at the beginning and
      at the end of session use
    - lastAccessedTime will only be updated at the end of
      session use
    This means:
    - lastAccessedTime is the last access time of a session
      disregarding any request still being processed on.
      So this is good to use even from within a request
      to detect when its own session has been used last before.
    - thisAccessedTime already gets updated when a new request 
      disregarding any request still being processed on.
      So this is better for any idleness check or information.
    - thisAccessedTime >= lastAccessedTime always
  - Port from StandardSession to DeltaSession
    http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=711714&view=rev
  - Expose thisAccessedTime via the session interface
    and ManagerBase, so we can use it from outside the session.
    http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=711716&view=rev
  - Make the classes checking session idleness use thisAccessedTime.
    http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=711720&view=rev
    This is not for invalidation, only for displaying
    idle times and making persistance decisions.

   0: billbarker: generally agree with remm that this is too big of a change for the stable branch
                 but could agree to some of it if it was split into parts
  -1: remm: no for TC 6.0
  -1: funkman : api change in Session.java for .x.x release

  +1: kkolinko: (
     good, I tested it and it fixes the issue,
     but I have the following comments:

     1. It works only if StandardSession.ACTIVITY_CHECK is true.
     And that occurs only if one of the following properties is "true":

       org.apache.catalina.session.StandardSession.ACTIVITY_CHECK
       org.apache.catalina.STRICT_SERVLET_COMPLIANCE

     Both are "false" by default, and that results in NullPointerException
     because StandardSession.accessCount is null in that case.

     That is expected, and just needs to be documented.
     Though some IllegalStateException might be better than NPE.

     Also maybe direct access to session.accessCount (a protected field of
     a class in the same package) is not a good style.

     2. In PersistentManagerBase.processMaxIdleSwaps():
     there is already the following line:
       "StandardSession session = (StandardSession) sessions[i];"

     Thus, there is no need for "if (sessions[i] instanceof StandardSession)" check
     in your patch, and you can access "session" instead of "session[i]".

     I think that "instanceof StandardSession" is a requirement, like
     ACTIVITY_CHECK one above, and thus it is no need for "instanceof"
     check. Just do a cast.

     3. PersistentValve class has "session.access()" call that I do not see
     how is balanced with "endAccess()". A reference to that session is just lost
     and not stored in a Request (that would release it in its recycle() method),
     so I think that additional "endAccess()" call is needed there. I have no
     experience with that class, though.
