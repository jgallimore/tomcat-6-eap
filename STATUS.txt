  +1: billbarker, remm

* Fix another license issue
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=598412&view=rev
  +1: markt, fhanik, pero, remm
  -1: billbarker  It is clear that simply making a copy doesn't release you from the original license.  
                  It is clear that Sun ownes the license on these files, and that will never change.
                  (markt) Agreed. However, I believe when originally commited these files were covered
                          by a CLA and the Sun text should never have been included. I am waiting for
                          confirmation of this from Sun before commit/revert.
  
* Add get/set methods for properties in the Tcp Failure detector
  http://people.apache.org/~fhanik/patches/tcpfaildet-getset.patch
  +1: fhanik, pero
  -1: 

* Fix http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=43706
  Copy/move should return 201
