                         Apache Tomcat 6.0 Patch Proposals
                         =================================


RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:

None


PATCHES PROPOSED TO BACKPORT:
  [ New proposals should be added at the end of the list ]

* Fix http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=56283
  Add support for running Tomcat 6 with ecj-P20140317-1600.jar (as drop-in
  replacement for ecj-4.3.1.jar). Add support for value "1.8" for the
  compilerSourceVM and compilerTargetVM options.
  Note that, per previous comments, ecj-P20140317-1600.jar can only be used when
  running with Java 6 or later. The "1.8" options make sense only when running
  with Java 8 (or later).

* Add a work around for validating XML documents (often TLDs) that use
  just the file name to refer to refer to the JavaEE schema on which they
  are based.
