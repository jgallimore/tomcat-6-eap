                         Apache Tomcat 6.0 Patch Proposals
                         =================================


RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:

None


PATCHES PROPOSED TO BACKPORT:
  [ New proposals should be added at the end of the list ]

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=56334#c15
  Fix a regression in EL parsing when quoted string follows a whitespace.

* Assert that MappingData object is empty before performing mapping work.
  It is backport of r1604663

  Motivation: Remove dead branches. Protect Mapper from operating on
  non-recycled MappingData. Using non-recycled MappingData might result in
  mapping request onto a different target, like an issue that prevented us
  from releasing 8.0.4 and fixed by r1580080/r1580083. I do not know such
  bugs in Tomcat 6, but I want the code to be more safe.
  Just a single (mappingData.host != null) check is enough to discern
  recycled vs. non-recycled data. Checks for other MappingData fields are
  removed by this patch, simplifying the code.

  A patch generated with "svn diff -x --ignore-space-change" for easier
  overview of the change is

* Fix generics warnings in Mapper.

  Motivation: Resolve IDE warnings to make it easier to spot more serious
  errors when working on this class.
  It is just some local variables. No change in functionality or APIs.

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=56829
  Add the ability for users to define their own values for _RUNJAVA and _RUNJDB.
  Based on a patch by Neeme Praks.

* Be more strict with executable filename on Windows (s/java/java.exe/).

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=43001
  Enable the JspC Ant task to set the JspC option mappedFile.

  Motivation: A really simple fix. The mappedFile option has different
  default (false) in JspC vs. EmbeddedServletOptions, and there was no way
  to configure it in an Ant task.

* Update documented minimum Ant version to use at build time to be 1.8.0

  Motivation: Align documentation with code.

  - Compatibility with Ant 1.6.5 was broken 6 years ago by r673614,
    as "osfamily" attribute of <exec> task is since Ant 1.7.0.
    Running `ant -f dist.xml` with Ant 1.6.5 fails with
    .../dist.xml:403: The <exec> type doesn't support the "osfamily" attribute.
  
  - Compatibility with Ant 1.7.x was broken 8 months ago by r1557724
    as <replace> task supports arbitrary collections such as <restrict>
    since Ant 1.8.
    Running `ant -f dist.xml` with Ant 1.7.0, 1.7.1 fails with
    .../dist.xml:239: The following error occurred while executing this line:
    .../dist.xml:258: replace doesn't support the nested "restrict" element.

  - Builds successfully with Ant 1.8.0.

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=56988
  Allow to use relative path in <code>base.path</code> setting when
  building Tomcat.

  Tested with Ant 1.8.0.

  Motivation: Allow to simplify configuration of automated CI tools that
  may run in different environments, e.g. Buildbot.

* Fix a potential resource leak in JDTCompiler when checking wether
  a resource is a package. Reported by Coverity Scan.

  Motivation: An obvious issue that is easy to fix.

* For https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=56079
  Switch to the signed versions of Apache Commons Daemon 1.0.15 binaries.

  Motivation: An improvement. As signed binaries are available, let's use
  them. I do not envision any drawbacks.

PATCHES/ISSUES THAT ARE STALLED:

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=44312
  Log an error if there is a conflict between Host and Alias names.
  Improve host management methods in Mapper to avoid occasionally removing
  a wrong host. Check that host management operations are performed on
  the host and not on an alias.

  2) http://svn.apache.org/r1608653

  4) TestMapper changes from http://svn.apache.org/r1608831

   kkolinko: Good for occasional review, but as backporting r1608833 won't
   be trivial I'd have to update the patch.
