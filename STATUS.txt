PATCHES PROPOSED TO BACKPORT:
  [ New proposals should be added at the end of the list ]


* Add ManagerBase session getLastAccessedTimestamp and getCreationTimestamp for better
  remote JMX access.
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=612971&view=rev
  +1: pero, rjung, fhanik, markt
  -1: remm: I believe it would need specific support for certain managers. Interested users
            could use their own extended manager instead.

* Remove old TLS code
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=616894&view=rev
  +1: markt, fhanik
  +0: remm: I don't see the point of backporting these API changing cleanups
            (markt) This is not an API change. It is just removing the TLS code
                    that has never been included in a 6.0.x src or bin release
           It's my fault for not building it in then. I'm not sure this is intentional,
           but I am ok with the change.

* Fix http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=44282
  Do call to getClassLoader() in a privileged block.
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=616953&view=rev
  +1: markt, fhanik
  +0: remm: do we really want to fix these sort of "bugs" ?
