                         Apache Tomcat 6.0 Patch Proposals
                         =================================


RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:

None


PATCHES PROPOSED TO BACKPORT:
  [ New proposals should be added at the end of the list ]

* Fix https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=57644
  Update examples to use Apache Standard Taglibs 1.2.3
  http://svn.apache.org/r1662736

    1) When running with Security Manager enabled, it fails at
       /examples/jsp/jsp2/tagfiles/products.jsp
       and many subsequent pages with
        java.security.AccessControlException: access denied (java.util.PropertyPermission org.apache.taglibs.standard.xml.accessExternalEntity read)
  
       followed by java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError which result in compilation failure.

       Without Security Manager it runs OK.

    2) Do not forget to update webapps/docs/changelog.xml

    3) OK with scan exclusion lists.
       Unlike Tomcat 7 and later there is no need to update them.

       (Tomcat 6 does not perform annotation scanning, so exclusion does
       not save much time. TLD exclusion lists are hard-coded in java code
       (e.g. search for "ecj-4.3.1.jar"), and do not skip jstl.jar.)


* Fix https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=57570
  Make processing of chunked encoding trailers an opt-in feature
  http://svn.apache.org/r1666396
  http://svn.apache.org/r1666407

PATCHES/ISSUES THAT ARE STALLED:

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=44312
  Log an error if there is a conflict between Host and Alias names.
  Improve host management methods in Mapper to avoid occasionally removing
  a wrong host. Check that host management operations are performed on
  the host and not on an alias.
  1) https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/attachment.cgi?id=31744
  2) http://svn.apache.org/r1608653
  3) http://svn.apache.org/r1608833
  4) TestMapper changes from http://svn.apache.org/r1608831
  +1: kkolinko, remm, schultz
  -1:
   kkolinko: Good for occasional review, but as backporting r1608833 won't
   be trivial I'd have to update the patch.
   schultz: r1608833 is good, but it does not look like it is absolutely
   required to fix BZ 44312.
