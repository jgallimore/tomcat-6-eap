                         Apache Tomcat 6.0 Patch Proposals
                         =================================


RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:


PATCHES ACCEPTED TO BACKPORT:
  [ start all new proposals below, under PATCHES PROPOSED. ]


PATCHES PROPOSED TO BACKPORT:
  [ New proposals should be added at the end of the list ]

* Fix the maven stuff for the maven repo.
  Before it does't find tomcat-juli.jar and the remoteRepository seems broken .
  http://people.apache.org/~jfclere/patches/maven.patch
  +1: jfclere
  -1: fhanik - easier to pass in the root path (lib/bin) to the macro instead of hacking around it
               if we remove the SCP auto feature, then there should be something to replace it with
               (http://ant.apache.org/manual/OptionalTasks/scp.html)  

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=48545
  Truststores don't have to have passwords
  Based on a patch by 'smmwpf54'
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=910266
  +1: markt
  -1: jfclere: Doc says it should use keystorePass (http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-6.0-doc/config/http.html).
               so that would break existing configurations.
      markt: It shouldn't break existing configs. JSSE allows trust stores to be
             read without providing the password

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=49030
  Failure of one connector should not leave some connectors started and some
  ignored
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=929521&view=rev
  +1: markt
  -1: 
  +0: kkolinko: good, but maybe we should also prevent against starting
    those connectors, that failed to initialize, in StandardService#start()?
    Also the message name (some generic name, "connector.failed"), vs.
    message text ("starting"),  vs. what actually happened (initialize()) -
    I won't insist on fixing that inconsistency.

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=48379
  Make session cookie name, domain and path configurable per context.
  Updated patch in response to review comments from kkolinko & rjung
  http://people.apache.org/~markt/patches/2010-06-07-bug48379.patch
  +1: markt
  -1: 

* Configure Tomcat to use HttpOnly for session cookies by default
  http://people.apache.org/~kkolinko/patches/2010-04-21_tc6_context_httpOnly.patch
  +1: kkolinko
  -0: markt - There wasn't consensus previously.
            - If you are going to change the default, do it in the code
  -1:

* Backport a couple of loader fixes and enhancements:

  Add property "searchExternalFirst" to WebappLoader:
  If set, the external repositories will be searched before
  the WEB-INF ones. Default (false) is unchanged behaviour.
  Also expose the new property via JMX and document it.
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=936823
  http://people.apache.org/~rjung/patches/2010-05-14-loader-backport-r936823.patch
  +1: rjung
  -1: markt - The new block
              if (hasExternalRepositories && searchExternalFirst) {...}
              needs to silently swallow CNFE to have same behaviour as previous
              code

  Expose the new WebappLoader flag in the VirtualWebappLoader,
  but allow alternative name searchVirtualFirst to make it
  consistent with the "virtual" terminology.
  Now you can decide, whether the virtual paths will
  be searched before the webapp or after it.
  If searched before, external resources take precendence
  over internal ones. Before that change one couldn't overwrite
  resources already present in the webapp.

  http://people.apache.org/~rjung/patches/2010-05-14-loader-backport-r936825.patch
  +1: rjung
  -1: 

  Respect configurable search order in getURLs().
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=936892
  http://people.apache.org/~rjung/patches/2010-05-14-loader-backport-r936892.patch
  +1: rjung
  -1: 

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=49343
  When ChannelException is thrown, remove listener from channel.
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=948402
  +1: kfujino, kkolinko
  -1: 
   kkolinko:
    Maybe "this.channel.removeChannelListener(this.rpcChannel);" call
    has to be replaced with "this.rpcChannel.breakdown();"
  
  Additional patch.
  "this.channel.removeChannelListener(this.rpcChannel);" call is 
  replaced with "this.rpcChannel.breakdown();". 
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=950922
  +1: kfujino, kkolinko
  -1: 

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=49099
  Provide a mechanism for including requests rejected by the CoyoteAdapter in
  the standard access log
  http://people.apache.org/~markt/patches/2010-07-07-bug49099.patch
  This is a backport of: r950587, r950809, r951018, r951093, r951447,
                         r951892, r952295
  +1: markt
  -1: 
   kkolinko: 1) It would be nice to log requests using the timestamp when it was
   received (like HTTPD 2.0+ does), not when it was processed. If that is to be
   implemented, an additional parameter will be needed for the log() method in
   the AccessLog interface. I suppose that might be "long t1, long t2" instead
   of "long time".
   2) I see no way to turn off this feature or filter the output.

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=48843#c8
  Fix handling the add queue in AprEndpoint.Poller and AprEndpoint.Sendfile.
  Do not miss Object.notify() wakeup.
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=950851&view=rev
  (Easier to review if you ignore whitespaces during the diff)
  +1: kkolinko, kfujino
  -1:

* Rearrange tomcat-juli permissions in catalina.policy for better readability,
  and wrap long lines, as already done in trunk and in security-manager-howto.
  The reason is that we have a copy of this file in security-manager-howto.html,
  and long lines break layout of the document.
  I am not very confident that this patch needs applying, but here it is.
  http://people.apache.org/~kkolinko/patches/2010-06-06_tc6_policy-juli.patch
  +1: kkolinko, rjung
  -1:
  rjung: Please remove the "all in one line" comment directly before the commented
         example line that you were breaking up into multiple lines.
