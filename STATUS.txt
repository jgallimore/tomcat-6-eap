                         Apache Tomcat 6.0 Patch Proposals
                         =================================


RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:

None


PATCHES PROPOSED TO BACKPORT:
  [ New proposals should be added at the end of the list ]

* Redefine the <code>globalXsltFile</code> initialisation parameter of the
  DefaultServlet as relative to CATALINA_BASE/conf or CATALINA_HOME/conf.
  Prevent user supplied XSLTs used by the DefaultServlet from defining external
  entities.

  +1: markt, kkolinko
  -1: schultz: The idea of the patch is fine: I'm actually +1.
               I have some small nits:
               1. DocumentBuilderFactory is not thread-safe, and shouldn't
               be shared. 2. Two instances of swallowing IOException
               when closing File streams. We should at least log a warning.
               It looks like there is an opportinity to use StringBuilder
               instead of StringBuffer, there, too, if you want.
      kkolinko:
        Re 1.:
          The newDocumentBuilder() method is thread safe.

          See JSR 206 (Final Release = JAXP 1.3)
          https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=206
          Ch.3 -> Thread Safety
          [quote]
             Implementations of the SAXParser, DocumentBuilder, Transformer, Validator and Validat
             orHandler abstract classes are not expected to be thread safe by this specification. (...)

             Configuration of a SAXParserFactory, DocumentBuilderFactory TransformerFactory or
             SchemaFactory is also not expected to be thread safe. (...)

             It is expected that the newSAXParser method of a SAXParserFactory implementation, the newDocument
             Builder method of a DocumentBuilderFactory and the newTransformer method of a Transformer
             Factory will be thread safe without side effects. (...)

             Note that Schema is thread safe.

        Re 2.:
          Those are input streams that are read, not written. Nothing
          should really happen when those are closed.

        Re StringBuilder:
          I think it is not of much concern. But if there is any interest,
          I am proposing a patch below. It is a 4 years old one.
  -1:

* Use StringBuilder in DefaultServlet
  Apply only DefaultServlet.java part of the following patch:
  https://people.apache.org/~kkolinko/patches/StringBuilder/2009-11-02_StringBuilder_o_a_c_servlets.patch

* Fix possible overflow when parsing long values from a byte array.

* Fix http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=56283
  Add Java 8 support to Jasper's default configuration
  http://people.apache.org/~markt/patches/2014-03-19-Jasper-Java8-tc6-v1.patch
  +1: markt
  +0: kkolinko:
       - See r1557990. There are noTldJars lists in TldConfig, TldLocationsCache
         that have to be updated. Maybe add support for "ecj-*.jar" pattern
         there? (If not, then just add "4.3.2" and "P20140317-1600" versions).

       - Technically CompilerOptions.VERSION_1_8 is a String constant "1.8",
         so it will be inlined at compile time. At runtime Jasper will be
         compatible with any earlier versions of ecj 4.3.x.
         Thus I am OK with this change.

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=56265
  Don't escape values for dynamic tag attributes

    kkolinko: Beware that changelog part of this patch merges into a wrong
    place. This change belongs to Jasper, not Catalina.

* Update tc-native to 1.1.29
