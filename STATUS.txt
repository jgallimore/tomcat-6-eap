                         Apache Tomcat 6.0 Patch Proposals
                         =================================


RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:


PATCHES ACCEPTED TO BACKPORT:
  [ start all new proposals below, under PATCHES PROPOSED. ]

PATCHES PROPOSED TO BACKPORT:
  [ New proposals should be added at the end of the list ]

* Fix issue where the first request for a deleted JSPs returns as if the JSP
  still exists.
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=683969
  +1: markt, funkman
   0: remm (looks risky, very minor problem), fhanik - minor problem
  -1: 

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=45403
  See commit message for details of negligable performance impact
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=701358&view=rev
  +1: markt, funkman
  -0: remm (I also do not think the patch is a good idea as a backport)
  -0: fhanik - the bug talks about WEB-INF/lib and reload, that would be when reload="true" which should be considered development only
      So to make this bug actually worth while fixing, and not impact performance, then it should only do this check on files that 
      are relevant to the reload of an application, in other words a watched resource

* Backport cleanup of semantics of thisAccessedTime and
  lastAccessedTime for sessions:
  - preparational whitespace changes
    http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=711695&view=rev
  - Give thisAccessedTime and lastAccessedTime for sessions
    a clear semantics:
    http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=711711&view=rev
    - thisAccessedTime will be updated at the beginning and
      at the end of session use
    - lastAccessedTime will only be updated at the end of
      session use
    This means:
    - lastAccessedTime is the last access time of a session
      disregarding any request still being processed on.
      So this is good to use even from within a request
      to detect when its own session has been used last before.
    - thisAccessedTime already gets updated when a new request 
      disregarding any request still being processed on.
      So this is better for any idleness check or information.
    - thisAccessedTime >= lastAccessedTime always
  - Port from StandardSession to DeltaSession
    http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=711714&view=rev
  - Expose thisAccessedTime via the session interface
    and ManagerBase, so we can use it from outside the session.
    http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=711716&view=rev
  - Make the classes checking session idleness use thisAccessedTime.
    http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=711720&view=rev
    This is not for invalidation, only for displaying
    idle times and making persistance decisions.
  +1: rjung, markt
   0: billbarker: generally agree with remm that this is too big of a change for the stable branch
                 but could agree to some of it if it was split into parts
  -1: remm: no for TC 6.0
  -1: funkman : api change in Session.java for .x.x release

* Fix Close Stream at WebappClassLoader after read error
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=772872&view=rev 
  +1: pero, funkman
  -0: kkolinko: http://marc.info/?l=tomcat-dev&m=124192105131636&w=2

* Dont try to report thread counts when using an executor from outside
  http://people.apache.org/~fhanik/connector-thread-report.patch
  +1: fhanik, kkolinko
  +1: markt - would 0 make more sense rather than -1? Happy with either
  -1: 

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=47369.
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=784879&view=rev

* When throwing Non-serializable exception, mark which argument was
  non-serializable to help tracing the cause when developing.
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=713953&view=rev
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=714002&view=rev
  6.0.x version of the patch:
  http://people.apache.org/~mturk/tomcat/setAttribute1.iae.patch
  +1: mturk, kkolinko, markt
  -1:

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=47158
  Update AccessLogValve with all the recent threading improvements
  http://people.apache.org/~markt/patches/2009-06-24-AccessLogValve-tc6.patch
  +1: markt
  -1: kkolinko: It cannot be applied without additional patches,
    because this change breaks ExtendedAccessLogValve.DateElement and
    TimeElement: Their "if (currentDate != date)" check is broken,
    because now the Date instance is reused in the same thread, and is
    different across threads.

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=38797
  Reverts previous fix for
  https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=37933 and implements an
  alternative that doesn't have the side effects described in 38797

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=47413
  First part of a composite EL expression "${a}${b}" was not coerced to String
  Without coercion, the concatenation of ((Object)null) + string results in
  "null" being printed.
