                         Apache Tomcat 6.0 Patch Proposals
                         =================================


RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:


PATCHES ACCEPTED TO BACKPORT:
  [ start all new proposals below, under PATCHES PROPOSED. ]


PATCHES PROPOSED TO BACKPORT:
  [ New proposals should be added at the end of the list ]

* Fix the maven stuff for the maven repo.
  Before it does't find tomcat-juli.jar and the remoteRepository seems broken .
  http://people.apache.org/~jfclere/patches/maven.patch
  +1: jfclere
  -1: fhanik - easier to pass in the root path (lib/bin) to the macro instead of hacking around it
               if we remove the SCP auto feature, then there should be something to replace it with
               (http://ant.apache.org/manual/OptionalTasks/scp.html)  

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=48545
  Truststores don't have to have passwords
  Based on a patch by 'smmwpf54'
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=910266
  +1: markt
  -1: jfclere: Doc says it should use keystorePass (http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-6.0-doc/config/http.html).
               so that would break existing configurations.
      markt: It shouldn't break existing configs. JSSE allows trust stores to be
             read without providing the password

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=48589
  Make JNDIRealm easier to extend
  Based on a patch by Candid Dauth
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=910485&view=rev
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=918489&view=rev (review feedback)
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=918803&view=rev (additional patch)
  +1: markt, kkolinko, rjung

  Additional patch:
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=932357
  +1: markt, kkolinko, rjung
  -1:

  Additional patch:
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=935983&view=rev
  +1: kkolinko, markt, rjung
  -1:

  rjung: It seems we add roles to the user's role list in
  getRoles(DirContext context, User user) every time it is
  being called, if either commonRole is used or roleFormat / roleName?
  I think we shouldn't change the original list, but instead a copy?

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=48729
  Return roles defined by both userRoleName and roleName mechanisms
  Patch provided by 'eric'
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=920824
  +1: markt, kkolinko
  -1: 
  rjung: see comment to the proposal above.

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=48737
  Don't assume paths that start with /META-INF/... are always in JARs. This is
  not true for some IDEs
  Patch provided by Fabrizio Giustina
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=920840&view=rev
  +1: markt, kkolinko, rjung
  -1: 

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=48701
  Take account of TagVariableInfo when implementing the rules of JSP.5.3
  http://people.apache.org/~markt/patches/2010-03-09-bug48701.patch
  +1: markt, kkolinko
  -1: 
  rjung: Patch withdrawn on p.a.o?

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=48793
  Make catalina.sh more robust to different return values on different platforms
  Patch provided by Thomas GL
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=921444&view=rev
  +1: markt, kkolinko, rjung
  -1: 

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=48795
  Provide an option to allow recompilation on the next request following a JSP
  compilation error rather than waiting modifcationTestInterval before the next
  attempt
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=922010&view=rev
  +1: markt, kkolinko, rjung
  -1: 
  rjung: Minor nit: we could add the actual value to the message "Invalid value ...".

  kkolinko: We have to mention the new parameter in jasper-howto.html#Configuration

* Correct SSL session timeout attribute name
  http://people.apache.org/~markt/patches/2010-04-07-SslSessionTimeout.patch
  +1: markt, kkolinko, rjung
  -1: 
   kkolinko: Generally, I would be against renaming some attributes, but this
    one is already documented as "sessionTimeout" in config/http.xml, though,
    still, renaming might break someone's configurations.

* Add support for displaying the Spring Security user name in the manager app
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=927062&view=rev
  +1: markt, kkolinko, rjung
  -1: 
  Capitalization is a bit counter intuitive w.r.t. the code comment
  "Lower and upper-case strings will be dynamically generated.
  Put mid-capitalised strings here!". But of course in case you know the
  right capitalization then it will be faster of adding it straight there.
  So it's only the comment, that is a bit to strict.

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=48840
  If CDPATH is set, cd may result in output to stdout.
  Swallow the output. This is safe since the script outputs the value used for
  CATALINA_HOME so any issues will be visible then.
  Patch provided by mdietze
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=928732&view=rev
  +1: markt
  -1: 
  rjung: I wouldn't redirect "2>&1". At least my tests show, that CDPATH
  output goes to stdout. stderr would still show, whether an error occured
  during the "cd".

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=48843
  Port deadlock prevention for worker allocation from NIO to BIO and APR
  https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/attachment.cgi?id=25225
  +1: kkolinko, markt, rjung
  -1:

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=49030
  Failure of one connector should not leave some connectors started and some
  ignored
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=929521&view=rev
  +1: markt
  -1: 
  +0: kkolinko: good, but maybe we should also prevent against starting
    those connectors, that failed to initialize, in StandardService#start()?
    Also the message name (some generic name, "connector.failed"), vs.
    message text ("starting"),  vs. what actually happened (initialize()) -
    I won't insist on fixing that inconsistency.

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=48379
  Make session cookie name, domain and path configurable per context.
  http://people.apache.org/~markt/patches/2010-05-05-bug48379.patch
  +1: markt, kkolinko, rjung
  -1:
   kkolinko: (Trivial:
     in JvmRouteBinderValve#setNewSessionCookie()
     in if (log.isDebugEnabled()) { ... } block
     s/Globals.SESSION_COOKIE_NAME/newCookie.getName()/
   )
   rjung: In CoyoteAdapter.parseSessionCookiesId(): should there be a check
   for context != null before calling context.getSessionCookieName()?
   At least a few lines above that place we chaeck context != null before calling
   context.getCookies(), so it seems someone wasn't sure, whether context could
   be null or not.

* sessionCounter and expiredSessions declares as long instead of int.
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=934337
  +1: kfujino
  -1: kkolinko: I think that we cannot change o.a.c.Manager API in such way
    in a dot release. Alternative proposal below.
  -1: markt: We can't change the API in 6. It will have to wait until 7.

* Fix possible overflows when calculating session statistics
  Fixes a) miscalculating the "average" because of multiplication overflow,
  b) ArithmeticException division by zero when numExpired overflows.
  The fix for trunk is already provided by r934337.
  http://people.apache.org/~kkolinko/patches/2010-04-21_tc6_StandardSession_statistics.patch
  +1: kkolinko, markt, rjung
  -1:

* Improve the ChatServlet comet example and fix some issues there
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=935105&view=rev
  +1: kkolinko, markt, rjung
  -1:

* Configure Tomcat to use HttpOnly for session cookies by default
  http://people.apache.org/~kkolinko/patches/2010-04-21_tc6_context_httpOnly.patch
  +1: kkolinko
  -0: markt - There wasn't consensus previosuly.
            - If you are going to change the default, do it in the code
  -1:

* Make the principal implement Serializable 
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=939491
  +1: fhanik, markt, kkolinko
  -1: 
  rjung: Should we add a serialVersionUID?

* Log unexpected errors in ApplicationContext#getResource() and #getResourceAsStream()
  This is inspired by https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=49218
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=939551&view=rev
  +1: kkolinko, markt, rjung
  -1:

* If any error happens in shutdown hook, do not forget to shutdown the
  logging subsystem.

  We have to take care of it, because logging shutdown hook is already
  disabled at that place. This way the unwritten messages in the cache will
  not be lost. Also if any more messages will come later, Handler.reportError()
  will write the first one of them to stderr, thus they will leave us a trace,
  instead of being lost in a buffer.
