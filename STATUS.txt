PATCHES PROPOSED TO BACKPORT:
  [ New proposals should be added at the end of the list ]


* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=55759
  Update the Eclipse compiler to 4.3.1

  +0: kkolinko: A Tomcat6-specific patch is needed. It needs update to jar
       exclude lists in TldConfig.java, TldLocationsCache.java, see r1476932.

* Back-port some XML processing improvements (part 4)
  Add a unit test for the new descriptor
  Note I am generating the patches using git so the patch shows whole new files
  being added. When actually making the commit, they will be copied from 7.0.x 
  and amended to retain history.

  +0: kkolinko:
      This requires JUnit4. Formally, "eclipse.classpath" file still uses
      JUnit 3 and if I understand correctly build.xml does not have JUnit
      on classpath, but uses whatever version is available with Ant, with
       <available classname="junit.framework.TestCase" property="junit.present" />

      A patch to introduce JUnit 4 may be to fix the Eclipse file and
      fix the availability check to look for a JUnit 4 class.
      (A more detailed solution may be based on r1408413, but that
      requires Ant >= 1.8.0).

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=55973
