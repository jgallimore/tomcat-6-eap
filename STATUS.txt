                         Apache Tomcat 6.0 Patch Proposals
                         =================================


RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:

None


PATCHES PROPOSED TO BACKPORT:
  [ New proposals should be added at the end of the list ]

* Assert that MappingData object is empty before performing mapping work.
  It is backport of r1604663

  Motivation: Remove dead branches. Protect Mapper from operating on
  non-recycled MappingData. Using non-recycled MappingData might result in
  mapping request onto a different target, like an issue that prevented us
  from releasing 8.0.4 and fixed by r1580080/r1580083. I do not know such
  bugs in Tomcat 6, but I want the code to be more safe.
  Just a single (mappingData.host != null) check is enough to discern
  recycled vs. non-recycled data. Checks for other MappingData fields are
  removed by this patch, simplifying the code.

  A patch generated with "svn diff -x --ignore-space-change" for easier
  overview of the change is

* Fix generics warnings in Mapper.

  Motivation: Resolve IDE warnings to make it easier to spot more serious
  errors when working on this class.
  It is just some local variables. No change in functionality or APIs.

     Good.
     I think this makes BZ 57116 fixed as well.
     Several notes:
      1) From BZ 56780 the static{} block in JSSESocketFactory
       needs try/catch(IllegalArgumentException),
       like it is already done in Tomcat 7 in r1615951

      2) In getEnabledProtocols() the
        "if (requestedProtocols == null) { return DEFAULT_SERVER_PROTOCOLS; }"
       block can be moved several lines earlier.

      3) From BZ 56780 the DEFAULT_SERVER_PROTOCOLS value might result as
      null. I am afraid that passing that null to Java APIs will result in
      some cryptic messages. This question may be addressed later via BZ 56780.
        https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=56780#c9

      schultz: it's not clear from the code what will happen if
               DEFAULT_SERVER_PROTOCOLS remains null. Would it be more clear
               to use an empty string array instead of null? I seem to recall
               slightly different "null" behavior in Oracle/OpenJDK versus
               IBM JVMs.

* Fix timestamps in Tomcat build to use 24-hour format instead of 12-hour
  one and use UTC timezone.

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=53952
  Add support for TLSv1.1 and TLSv1.2 to APR connector.
  Back-port r1632606 from Tomcat 7.

  +1: schultz, kkolinko

   kkolinko:
    1) It depends on a newer TC-Native. The "ALL" value of protocol
    (default) will break if it is run with an older version.
    As such, it needs to wait until TC-Native is released and it needs bump
    in recommended/required TC-Native version in AprLifecycleListener.
    Such bump may be addressed as a separate proposal.

    2) Documentation patch is off.
    The "SSLCACertificateFile" and other properties are documented in
    Tomcat 6 in docs/apr.html
    (In Tomcat 7 they were moved to config/http.html, config/ajp.html for
    consistency, but that move have not been ported to Tomcat 6
    documentation yet. OK to backport that if you have time. Docs are CTR.
    But I am -1 to documenting it twice in new and old place like the
    proposed patch does.)

    3) In documentation "and any combination of the three protocols"

    There are five protocols now.

    4) Changelog part of the patch breaks XML. Tags are not paired.

PATCHES/ISSUES THAT ARE STALLED:

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=44312
  Log an error if there is a conflict between Host and Alias names.
  Improve host management methods in Mapper to avoid occasionally removing
  a wrong host. Check that host management operations are performed on
  the host and not on an alias.

   kkolinko: Good for occasional review, but as backporting r1608833 won't
   be trivial I'd have to update the patch.
