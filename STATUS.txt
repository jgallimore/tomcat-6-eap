                         Apache Tomcat 6.0 Patch Proposals
                         =================================


RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:


PATCHES ACCEPTED TO BACKPORT:
  [ start all new proposals below, under PATCHES PROPOSED. ]


PATCHES PROPOSED TO BACKPORT:
  [ New proposals should be added at the end of the list ]

* Backport cleanup of semantics of thisAccessedTime and
  lastAccessedTime for sessions:
  - preparational whitespace changes
    http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=711695&view=rev
  - Give thisAccessedTime and lastAccessedTime for sessions
    a clear semantics:
    http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=711711&view=rev
    - thisAccessedTime will be updated at the beginning and
      at the end of session use
    - lastAccessedTime will only be updated at the end of
      session use
    This means:
    - lastAccessedTime is the last access time of a session
      disregarding any request still being processed on.
      So this is good to use even from within a request
      to detect when its own session has been used last before.
    - thisAccessedTime already gets updated when a new request
      disregarding any request still being processed on.
      So this is better for any idleness check or information.
    - thisAccessedTime >= lastAccessedTime always
  - Port from StandardSession to DeltaSession
    http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=711714&view=rev
  - Expose thisAccessedTime via the session interface
    and ManagerBase, so we can use it from outside the session.
    http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=711716&view=rev
  - Make the classes checking session idleness use thisAccessedTime.
    http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=711720&view=rev
    This is not for invalidation, only for displaying
    idle times and making persistance decisions.
  +1: rjung
   0: billbarker: generally agree with remm that this is too big of a change for the stable branch
                 but could agree to some of it if it was split into parts
   0: markt: Agree with Bill - smaller parts would be better
  -1: remm: no for TC 6.0
  -1: funkman : api change in Session.java for .x.x release

* Fix the maven stuff for the maven repo.
  Before it does't find tomcat-juli.jar and the remoteRepository seems broken .
  http://people.apache.org/~jfclere/patches/maven.patch
  +1: jfclere
  -1: fhanik - easier to pass in the root path (lib/bin) to the macro instead of hacking around it
               if we remove the SCP auto feature, then there should be something to replace it with
               (http://ant.apache.org/manual/OptionalTasks/scp.html)  

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=48545
  Truststores don't have to have passwords
  Based on a patch by 'smmwpf54'
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=910266
  +1: markt
  -1: jfclere: Doc says it should use keystorePass (http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-6.0-doc/config/http.html).
               so that would break existing configurations.
      markt: It shouldn't break existing configs. JSSE allows trust stores to be
             read without providing the password

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=48589
  Make JNDIRealm easier to extend

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=48737
  Don't assume paths that start with /META-INF/... are always in JARs. This is
  not true for some IDEs
  Patch provided by Fabrizio Giustina

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=48795
  Provide an option to allow recompilation on the next request following a JSP
  compilation error rather than waiting modifcationTestInterval before the next
  attempt
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=922010&view=rev
  +1: markt
  -1: 

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=48903
  and https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=48694#c8
  Fix deadlock /sync issues in WebappClassLoader. Revert to using
  synchronized(this) as analysis and experience shows anything else will just
  cause problems
  The patch looks bug but it just removes the sync block and sync's the method
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=927565&view=rev
  +1: markt, kkolinko
  -1: 

  Additional patch:
  Mark ResourceEntry.loadedClass as volatile.
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=927877&view=rev
  +1: kkolinko, markt
  -1:

  Note: (kkolinko): Applied to 5.5.x in r935947. The above patches address
  BZ 44041, BZ 48903, BZ 48694. Those three issues are to be marked as RESOLVED,
  when these patches are applied.


* Correct SSL session timeout attribute name
  http://people.apache.org/~markt/patches/2010-04-07-SslSessionTimeout.patch
  +1: markt
  -1: 
   kkolinko: Generally, I would be against renaming some attributes, but this
    one is already documented as "sessionTimeout" in config/http.xml, though,
    still, renaming might break someone's configurations.

* Add support for displaying the Spring Security user name in the manager app
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=927062&view=rev
  +1: markt, kkolinko
  -1: 

* Re-fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=45015

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=48717
  When a node joins a cluster and it receives all the current sessions, ensure
  the sessionCreated event is fired if the Manager is configured to replicate
  session events
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=928482&view=rev
  +1: markt, kkolinko, kfujino

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=48839
  Correctly handle multi-line headers with the NIO connector
  Patch suggested by Richa Baronia

  -1: 

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=48840
  If CDPATH is set, cd may result in output to stdout.
  Swallow the output. This is safe since the script outputs the value used for
  CATALINA_HOME so any issues will be visible then.
  Patch provided by mdietze

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=48843
  Port deadlock prevention for worker allocation from NIO to BIO and APR
  http://people.apache.org/~markt/patches/2010-03-29-bug48843-tc6.patch
  +1: markt
  +1: kkolinko: I will work, but I think that leaving/re-entering
    synchronization when we are inside the loop is unneeded extra overhead.
    Thus I am proposing another patch below.
  -1: 

  Alternative patch:
  Note: This was applied to 5.5 in r934922
  No need to apply this to trunk, because there are no Workers in trunk.

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=49030
  Failure of one connector should not leave some connectors started and some
  ignored
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=929521&view=rev
  +1: markt
  -1: 
  +0: kkolinko: good, but maybe we should also prevent against starting
    those connectors, that failed to initialize, in StandardService#start()?
    Also the message name (some generic name, "connector.failed"), vs.
    message text ("starting"),  vs. what actually happened (initialize()) -
    I won't insist on fixing that inconsistency.

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=48379
  Make session cookie name, domain and path configurable per context.
  http://people.apache.org/~markt/patches/2010-04-08-bug48379.patch
  +1: markt, kfujino
  -1: kkolinko: Re: @@ -2252,22 +2252,11 @@ patch to Request.java:
    There is (context == null) check just below the changed lines. Either
    that check is not needed, or the changed code may throw an NPE on
    context.getSessionCookieName() call.

  If session is already invalid, expire session to prevent memory leak. 
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=933881
  +1: kfujino, markt, kkolinko
  -1: 

* sessionCounter and expiredSessions declares as long instead of int.
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=934337
  +1: kfujino
  -1: kkolinko: I think that we cannot change o.a.c.Manager API in such way
    in a dot release. Alternative proposal below.
  -1: markt: We can't change the API in 6. It will have to wait until 7.

* Fix possible overflows when calculating session statistics
  Fixes a) miscalculating the "average" because of multiplication overflow,
  b) ArithmeticException division by zero when numExpired overflows.
  The fix for trunk is already provided by r934337.

  -1: kkolinko: 1) because Response#addSessionCookieInternal(..) skips
        cookies.add(cookie); call
        2) you need to take care of the useHttpOnly flag
  -1: 

* Configure Tomcat to use HttpOnly for session cookies by default

  Do not use indexing when packing Tomcat JARs.
  In TC6 it affects the DBCP and JDT jars.

  +1: kkolinko
  -1:

* If any error happens in shutdown hook, do not forget to shutdown the
  logging subsystem.

  We have to take care of it, because logging shutdown hook is already
  disabled at that place. This way the unwritten messages in the cache will
  not be lost. Also if any more messages will come later, Handler.reportError()
  will write the first one of them to stderr, thus they will leave us a trace,
  instead of being lost in a buffer.
