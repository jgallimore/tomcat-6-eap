                         Apache Tomcat 6.0 Patch Proposals
                         =================================


RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:


PATCHES ACCEPTED TO BACKPORT:
  [ start all new proposals below, under PATCHES PROPOSED. ]

PATCHES PROPOSED TO BACKPORT:
  [ New proposals should be added at the end of the list ]

* Fix issue where the first request for a deleted JSPs returns as if the JSP
  still exists.
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=683969
  +1: markt, funkman
   0: remm (looks risky, very minor problem), fhanik - minor problem
  -1: 

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=45403
  See commit message for details of negligable performance impact
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=701358&view=rev
  +1: markt, funkman
  -0: remm (I also do not think the patch is a good idea as a backport)
  -0: fhanik - the bug talks about WEB-INF/lib and reload, that would be when reload="true" which should be considered development only
      So to make this bug actually worth while fixing, and not impact performance, then it should only do this check on files that 
      are relevant to the reload of an application, in other words a watched resource

* Backport cleanup of semantics of thisAccessedTime and
  lastAccessedTime for sessions:
  - preparational whitespace changes
    http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=711695&view=rev
  - Give thisAccessedTime and lastAccessedTime for sessions
    a clear semantics:
    http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=711711&view=rev
    - thisAccessedTime will be updated at the beginning and
      at the end of session use
    - lastAccessedTime will only be updated at the end of
      session use
    This means:
    - lastAccessedTime is the last access time of a session
      disregarding any request still being processed on.
      So this is good to use even from within a request
      to detect when its own session has been used last before.
    - thisAccessedTime already gets updated when a new request 
      disregarding any request still being processed on.
      So this is better for any idleness check or information.
    - thisAccessedTime >= lastAccessedTime always
  - Port from StandardSession to DeltaSession
    http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=711714&view=rev
  - Expose thisAccessedTime via the session interface
    and ManagerBase, so we can use it from outside the session.
    http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=711716&view=rev
  - Make the classes checking session idleness use thisAccessedTime.
    http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=711720&view=rev
    This is not for invalidation, only for displaying
    idle times and making persistance decisions.
  +1: rjung, markt
   0: billbarker: generally agree with remm that this is too big of a change for the stable branch
                 but could agree to some of it if it was split into parts
  -1: remm: no for TC 6.0
  -1: funkman : api change in Session.java for .x.x release

* Fix Close Stream at WebappClassLoader after read error

  -1: kkolinko: (
      good in general, but
      1) please use native2ascii for LocalStrings_fr.properties
      s/ e / \u00nn /
      2) o.a.c.session.ha.session.LocalString*.properties files also have this string.
      Should it be removed from there, or updated there also?
