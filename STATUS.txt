                         Apache Tomcat 6.0 Patch Proposals
                         =================================


RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:


PATCHES ACCEPTED TO BACKPORT:
  [ start all new proposals below, under PATCHES PROPOSED. ]


PATCHES PROPOSED TO BACKPORT:
  [ New proposals should be added at the end of the list ]

* Backport cleanup of semantics of thisAccessedTime and
  lastAccessedTime for sessions:
  - preparational whitespace changes
    http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=711695&view=rev
  - Give thisAccessedTime and lastAccessedTime for sessions
    a clear semantics:
    http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=711711&view=rev
    - thisAccessedTime will be updated at the beginning and
      at the end of session use
    - lastAccessedTime will only be updated at the end of
      session use
    This means:
    - lastAccessedTime is the last access time of a session
      disregarding any request still being processed on.
      So this is good to use even from within a request
      to detect when its own session has been used last before.
    - thisAccessedTime already gets updated when a new request
      disregarding any request still being processed on.
      So this is better for any idleness check or information.
    - thisAccessedTime >= lastAccessedTime always
  - Port from StandardSession to DeltaSession
    http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=711714&view=rev
  - Expose thisAccessedTime via the session interface
    and ManagerBase, so we can use it from outside the session.
    http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=711716&view=rev
  - Make the classes checking session idleness use thisAccessedTime.
    http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=711720&view=rev
    This is not for invalidation, only for displaying
    idle times and making persistance decisions.
  +1: rjung
   0: billbarker: generally agree with remm that this is too big of a change for the stable branch
                 but could agree to some of it if it was split into parts
   0: markt: Agree with Bill - smaller parts would be better
  -1: remm: no for TC 6.0
  -1: funkman : api change in Session.java for .x.x release

* Allow special characters recognized by the Windows command-line shell to
  be present in the names of CATALINA_HOME/_BASE and the current directory
  used to call the Tomcat scripts.
  Fixes the problem reported for the '&' character:
    https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=48464#c4
  "help cmd" lists the following characters as special:
   <space> and &()[]{}^=;!'+,`~
  Note that:
   - cd, set, echo commands have to use quotes when a name contains '&'
   - names containing the space character are already working without this patch
  Patch:
  http://people.apache.org/~kkolinko/patches/2010-01-03_bug48464-c4_ampersand_tc6.patch
  (a backport of revs. 895191, 895392)
  Tested on Windows XP.

  rjung: I would slightly prefer to apply after we finally managed to produce a working
         release for 6.0.x, since changes in the Windows bat files are hard to test
         for all possible cases, paths etc.
         The 'set "a=%b%"' trick is nice, because if you only use the quotation
         marks around the rhs, Windows actually adds them to the value of 'a'.

* Force disconnect upon transmission failure
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=898906&view=rev

* Allow compliance with SRV.15.2.22.1 to be controlled separately
  from STRICT_SERVLET_COMPLIANCE, and turn it on by default.
  If anyone has a better proposal for the property name, you are welcome.
  Tomcat 5.5 implementation of o.a.c.connector.Response applies this
  unconditionally, so this patch will also provide better compliance with
  TC 5.5.
