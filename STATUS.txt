                         Apache Tomcat 6.0 Patch Proposals
                         =================================


RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:

None


PATCHES PROPOSED TO BACKPORT:
  [ New proposals should be added at the end of the list ]

* Enabling building with Java 8
  http://people.apache.org/~markt/patches/2014-04-12-build-with-java8-tc6-v1.patch
  (Note: It is easier to verify the AbstractReplicatedMap changes by diffing
         against the Tomcat 7 version of the class)
  +1: markt, remm, fhanik
  -1:

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=56369
  Ensure that removing an MBean notification listener
  reverts all the operations performed when adding an MBean notification
  listener.
  http://svn.apache.org/r1586897
  http://svn.apache.org/r1586960

* Back-port patch to allow different kinds of FIPS configuration.
  http://people.apache.org/~schultz/patches/tcnative.heartbleed.tomcat6.diff
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=r1587379
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&amp;revision=r1587723 (adapt)
  (Note: requires tcnative 1.1.30)
  +1: schultz, markt, remm
  -1: kkolinko:
       a) I cannot test (without FIPS-enabled library), but from my code review
          the new options will not work because you are not setting
          "fipsModeActive" field in AprLifecycleListener.

          Thus AprLifecycleListener.isFIPSModeActive() will return false
          and startup will be aborted.

       b) It needs backport of r1588102 as an Exception is thrown by native code

       c) "enterFipsMode = 1 != fipsModeState;" code and comment before it are wrong.

          FIPS_mode() function of OpenSSL is documented to return non-zero
          value when in FIPS mode. You cannot expect it to be '1'.
          Reference:
           http://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/FIPS_mode%28%29

* Avoid memory leak and add small optimisation to default Servlet
