                         Apache Tomcat 6.0 Patch Proposals
                         =================================


RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:


PATCHES ACCEPTED TO BACKPORT:
  [ start all new proposals below, under PATCHES PROPOSED. ]

PATCHES PROPOSED TO BACKPORT:
  [ New proposals should be added at the end of the list ]


* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=55759
  Update the Eclipse compiler to 4.3.1
  http://people.apache.org/~markt/patches/2014-01-13-ecj-4.3.1-update-tc6-v1.patch
  +1: markt, remm, mturk
  +0: kkolinko: A Tomcat6-specific patch is needed. It needs update to jar
       exclude lists in TldConfig.java, TldLocationsCache.java, see r1476932.
      markt: Patch updated
  -1:

* Back-port some XML processing improvements (part 4)
  Add a unit test for the new descriptor
  Note I am generating the patches using git so the patch shows whole new files
  being added. When actually making the commit, they will be copied from 7.0.x 
  and amended to retain history.
  Note: Part 5 onwards do not depend on this patch so this could be ignored /
        addressed later without impacting the XML changes.
  http://people.apache.org/~markt/patches/2013-12-19-xml-prep-part4-tc6-v1.patch
  +1: markt, remm, mturk
  +0: kkolinko:
      This requires JUnit4. Formally, "eclipse.classpath" file still uses
      JUnit 3 and if I understand correctly build.xml does not have JUnit
      on classpath, but uses whatever version is available with Ant, with
       <available classname="junit.framework.TestCase" property="junit.present" />

      A patch to introduce JUnit 4 may be to fix the Eclipse file and
      fix the availability check to look for a JUnit 4 class.
      (A more detailed solution may be based on r1408413, but that
      requires Ant >= 1.8.0).

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=55671
  Consistent naming for genStringAsCharArray
  https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/attachment.cgi?id=31187
  +1: markt, remm, mturk
  -0: kkolinko: I think "genStrAsCharArray" is the proper and
        documented name for Tomcat 6. If we change the init-param name
        for better compatibility with Tomcat 7 (a good thing, +1),
        the code should check both the new and the old param names.
        It also needs r1556725.
        https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=55671#c1
      markt: patch updated
  -1:

* Add an option to the Context to control the blocking of XML external entities
  when parsing XML configuration files and enable this blocking by default when
  a security manager is used. The block is implemented via a custom resolver to
  enable the logging of any blocked entities.
  Backport of https://svn.apache.org/r1549529
