RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:

None


PATCHES PROPOSED TO BACKPORT:
  [ New proposals should be added at the end of the list ]

* Add support for maxSwallowSize to Tomcat 6
  http://people.apache.org/~markt/patches/2015-02-06-maxSwallowSize-tc6-v2.patch
  +1: markt
  -1:

* Backport some Jasper clean-up that might provide a marginal performance
  improvement. Even if it doesn't it removes some unnecessary code
  http://people.apache.org/~markt/patches/2015-02-06-jasper-cleanup-tc6-v1.patch
  +1: markt, kkolinko
  -1:

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=57544
  Avoid potential infinite loop. Chances are this is only triggered by code
  (WebSocket, non-blocking, async) that isn't in 6.0.x but better to clean it up
  anyway.
  http://people.apache.org/~markt/patches/2015-02-08-bug57544-tc6-v1.patch
  +1: markt, kkolinko
  -1:

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=57558
  Add missing JARs in Ant task definition. Expand the pattern in
  catalina-tasks.xml to incude all jars in ${catalina.home}/lib.
  This adds catalina.jar required by the validate task, as well as optional
  i18n jars.

* Simplify code in ProtectedFunctionMapper class of Jasper runtime.

PATCHES/ISSUES THAT ARE STALLED:

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=44312
  Log an error if there is a conflict between Host and Alias names.
  Improve host management methods in Mapper to avoid occasionally removing
  a wrong host. Check that host management operations are performed on
  the host and not on an alias.

  2) http://svn.apache.org/r1608653
  3) http://svn.apache.org/r1608833
  4) TestMapper changes from http://svn.apache.org/r1608831
  +1: kkolinko, remm
  -1:
   kkolinko: Good for occasional review, but as backporting r1608833 won't
   be trivial I'd have to update the patch.
