PATCHES PROPOSED TO BACKPORT:
  [ New proposals should be added at the end of the list ]

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=56780
  Enable Tomcat to start when using a IBM JRE in strict SP800-131a mode
  This back-ports the fix as well as some additional changes to more closely

PATCHES/ISSUES THAT ARE STALLED:

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=44312
  Log an error if there is a conflict between Host and Alias names.
  Improve host management methods in Mapper to avoid occasionally removing
  a wrong host. Check that host management operations are performed on
  the host and not on an alias.

   kkolinko: Good for occasional review, but as backporting r1608833 won't
   be trivial I'd have to update the patch.
