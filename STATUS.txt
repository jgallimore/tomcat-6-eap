                         Apache Tomcat 6.0 Patch Proposals
                         =================================


RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:


PATCHES ACCEPTED TO BACKPORT:
  [ start all new proposals below, under PATCHES PROPOSED. ]

PATCHES PROPOSED TO BACKPORT:
  [ New proposals should be added at the end of the list ]

* Fix the maven stuff for the maven repo.
  Before it does't find tomcat-juli.jar and the remoteRepository seems broken .
  http://people.apache.org/~jfclere/patches/maven.patch.100711
  +1: jfclere
  -1: fhanik - easier to pass in the root path (lib/bin) to the macro instead of hacking around it
               if we remove the SCP auto feature, then there should be something to replace it with
               (http://ant.apache.org/manual/OptionalTasks/scp.html)
  +1: kkolinko: +1 for the updated patch (maven.patch.100711)
      I still think that it is not so good to remove the old code of <remoteRepository/>,
      because it ignores ${maven.repo.url} parameter provided by deploy-snapshot,
      deploy-staging and deploy-release targets. Maybe leave old code as a comment
      and fix it later if needed? I think that actually nobody besides the release manager
      uses this, so I am letting this pass.

* Expose the new WebappLoader flag in the VirtualWebappLoader,
  but allow alternative name searchVirtualFirst to make it
  consistent with the "virtual" terminology.
  Now you can decide, whether the virtual paths will
  be searched before the webapp or after it.
  If searched before, external resources take precendence
  over internal ones. Before that change one couldn't overwrite
  resources already present in the webapp.

  -0: kkolinko: The patch itself is OK, but I think having a synonym will
   cause confusion. I'd prefer not to invent a new name, but mention the
   one that we already have when documenting virtualClasspath.

* Fix path parameter handling. Currently the following URL fails with a 404:
  http://localhost:8080/examples/jsp/snp;x=y/snoop.jsp
  http://people.apache.org/~kkolinko/patches/2010-11-17_tc6_path-params.patch
  +1: kkolinko, markt
  -1:

   kkolinko: The old parseSessionId() method calls "clearRequestedSessionURL(request);"
     when there is no sessionid in the path. The new code does not do that. Was that
     call needed? It looks that it was not needed, but I might miss something.

   kkolinko: Discussed in Re:r1005192 thread on dev@


* Backport JSP unloading patch (BZ48358).
  The patch has substantially changed since the original version.
  Original revisions are: 937787, 1028377, 1028389, 1028396, 1028861, 1028862, 1028863,
  1028935, 1028939, 1028940, 1028944, 1028950, 1030014, 1030037
  Combined TC 6 patch:
  http://people.apache.org/~rjung/patches/BZ48358-JSP_Unloading-TC6_20101118.patch
  +1: rjung
  -0: markt - http://markmail.org/thread/777be426ulcfmdd3 suggests there may be
              a memory leak in this code somewhere. I'd like to get to the
              bottom of that before porting this
      rjung:  I started a discussion about JSPs and memory on the dev list.
              The updated patch fixes a race condition.
              We can stall this item until we get some feedback about 7.0.5.

  +1: markt
  +1: schultz : if s/nOnce/nonce/g for the whole file, not just some of it
  -1:

* Update download paths in build.properties.default:
  Use maven2 repository, because servletapi-2.3 disappeared from the maven1
  one. These downloads are needed when building extras.
  It is backport of r1072962
  http://people.apache.org/~kkolinko/patches/2011-04-03_tc6_maven2.patch

  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1090022
  +1: schultz
  +1: kkolinko: +1, but I think it is better to combine this with r1073393
      (http://markmail.org/message/vkao3gcwe2w63jxj)

  Make Tomcat more robust if an OOME occurs. Yes, after an OOME all bets are off
  but this patch appears to help some users and the description of a
  'recoverable' OOME in the bug is a plausible one.

  Correct ClassLoaderLogManager system property replacement code so properties
  of the form ${...}${...} can be used without error.

  kkolinko: Alternative proposal below.

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=51249
  Improve system property replacement code in ClassLoaderLogManager of Tomcat JULI.
  1) Tests
   svn copy "^/tomcat/trunk/test/org/apache/juli" "test/org/apache/juli"
  2) Patch (backport of r1133857)
   http://people.apache.org/~kkolinko/patches/2011-06-09_tc6_ClassLoaderLogManager.patch
  It fixes the following issues:
   1. Correctly search for "}" so properties in the form "}${property}" are
   correctly replaced. This is BZ 51249.
   Note, that ${property}${property} is already working in 6.0.32, thanks to recursion.
   2. Do not stop processing on first unrecognized property.
   The old code did not perform recursion if replacement failed.
   3. Do not call System.getProperty() for empty property name,
   which was throwing IllegalArgumentException.
