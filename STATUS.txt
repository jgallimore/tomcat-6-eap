RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:


PATCHES ACCEPTED TO BACKPORT:
  [ start all new proposals below, under PATCHES PROPOSED. ]

PATCHES PROPOSED TO BACKPORT:
  [ New proposals should be added at the end of the list ]

* Fix issue where the first request for a deleted JSPs returns as if the JSP
  still exists.
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=683969
  +1: markt, funkman
   0: remm (looks risky, very minor problem), fhanik - minor problem
  -1: 

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=45026
  Never use empty reason phrase.
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=697183&view=rev
  +1: rjung, mturk, markt, jim
   0: remm (also affects to the two other AJP connectors)

* Allow huge request body packets for AJP13.
  This was already applied to connectors, but never
  carried forward to trunk and tc6.0.x.
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=697192&view=rev
  Original change: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=486217&view=rev
  +1: rjung, mturk, markt, pero, jim
   0: remm (also affects to the two other AJP connectors)

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=45403
  See commit message for details of negligable performance impact
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=701358&view=rev
  +1: markt, funkman
  -0: remm (I also do not think the patch is a good idea as a backport)
  -0: fhanik - the bug talks about WEB-INF/lib and reload, that would be when reload="true" which should be considered development only
      So to make this bug actually worth while fixing, and not impact performance, then it should only do this check on files that 
      are relevant to the reload of an application, in other words a watched resource

* Changes required to run with a security manager

  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=721708&view=rev (original)
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=721886&view=rev (original)
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=746425&view=rev (to address Bill's concerns)
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=757335&view=rev (to remove the Catalina dep)
  +1: markt
   0: billbarker: Haven't tried to break it yet, but the 4th patch potentially
      offers access to static fields in ELContextImpl and ELResolverImpl that could 
      possibly be exploited by a malicious webapp.
  -1: billbarker: The 5th patch makes Jasper depend on Catalina, rendering Jasper useless
      to any 3rd party that just wants a JSP compiler.  Removing the Catalina dependancy
      can change my vote to +1 (although, it means trusting modern JVMs to clean up after
      themselves efficiently).

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=46351
  Build script re-factoring
  Patch provided by Marc Guillemot
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=729681&view=rev
  +1: markt, jim, pero
   0: fhanik - not sure its needed in 6.0 branch if all is working with the old script
   0: funkman - ditto
  -1:

* Deprecate unused code (with a view to deleting it in TC7
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=719119
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=719124
  +1: markt, fhanik, rjung
  -0: mturk: We cannot change API in the middle of the life cycle. I'm fine with
      deprecating that in trunk, but IMO there is no reason to deprecate
      something in maintenance branch.
      markt: I'd like to delete a lot of stuff (that is already unused) in tc7.
      Deprecating it in tc6 doesn't stop people using it, nor does it change the
      functionality of the API. It just gives folks that may be using this old
      code a warning that it won't be there in the next version.
  -1: 
  rjung: deprecating the unused collection classes is fine.
  Not sure about the purpose of the apr.properties handling class.

  -1:

  numbers in the AJP conectors. Backport of
