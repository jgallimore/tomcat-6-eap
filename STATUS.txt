                         Apache Tomcat 6.0 Patch Proposals
                         =================================


RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:


PATCHES ACCEPTED TO BACKPORT:
  [ start all new proposals below, under PATCHES PROPOSED. ]

PATCHES PROPOSED TO BACKPORT:
  [ New proposals should be added at the end of the list ]

* Fix the maven stuff for the maven repo.
  Before it does't find tomcat-juli.jar and the remoteRepository seems broken .
  http://people.apache.org/~jfclere/patches/maven.patch.100711
  +1: jfclere
  -1: fhanik - easier to pass in the root path (lib/bin) to the macro instead of hacking around it
               if we remove the SCP auto feature, then there should be something to replace it with
               (http://ant.apache.org/manual/OptionalTasks/scp.html)
  +1: kkolinko: +1 for the updated patch (maven.patch.100711)
      I still think that it is not so good to remove the old code of <remoteRepository/>,
      because it ignores ${maven.repo.url} parameter provided by deploy-snapshot,
      deploy-staging and deploy-release targets. Maybe leave old code as a comment
      and fix it later if needed? I think that actually nobody besides the release manager
      uses this, so I am letting this pass.

* Add StuckThreadDetectionValve
  https://github.com/sylvainlaurent/tomcat60/commit/252334f958877221ecb2dc64ee0fd12bb77e360b
  +1: slaurent
  +1: kkolinko: several comments are below

  kkolinko: To view/download this as a patch file you add ".diff" to the URL above. That is:
  https://github.com/sylvainlaurent/tomcat60/commit/252334f958877221ecb2dc64ee0fd12bb77e360b.diff

  kkolinko: Minor glitches:
    - In mbeans-descriptors.xml:
      - There are no properties "asyncSupported", "stateName" in TC6 version of this valve.
    - In valve.xml:
      - s/tomcat log/Tomcat log/ (or Apache Tomcat log)
    - In StuckThreadDetectionValve.java:
      - s/private class CompletedStuckThread/private static class CompletedStuckThread/
        MonitoredThread can be made static as well.
      - result[i] = idList.get(i); and arguments to sm.getString()
        I'd prefer the boxing/unboxing conversion to be coded explicitly.
      - s/new Long(/Long.valueOf(/
      - ConcurrentHashMap: Maybe the defaults could be tuned with system properties.
        I wonder whether ConcurrentHashMap.DEFAULT_CONCURRENCY_LEVEL which is 16 is enough.
      - getStuckThreadIds() returns a list of ids. It might be useful to
        have a similar method that returns Thread.getName() names.

* Replace unneeded call that iterated events queue in NioEndpoint.Poller.
  There is no need to call size() on a liked list to check whether it is empty,
  especially if it is followed by us iterating the list by ourselves.

* bug 51862: JreMemoryLeakPreventionListener enhancement to load configurable classes 
  https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=51862
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=1174359&view=rev
  +1: slaurent, kkolinko
  -1: 

  kkolinko: In trunk it is r1174353. Maybe better to merge from there
  instead of r1174359, for consistency. The code is the same in both.

* Add build date and version to documentation pages
  Automate copyright end date
  It is based on r962466

PATCHES/ISSUES THAT ARE STALLED

* Backport JSP unloading patch (BZ48358).
  The patch has substantially changed since the original version.
  Original revisions are: 937787, 1028377, 1028389, 1028396, 1028861, 1028862, 1028863,
  1028935, 1028939, 1028940, 1028944, 1028950, 1030014, 1030037
  Combined TC 6 patch:
  http://people.apache.org/~rjung/patches/BZ48358-JSP_Unloading-TC6_20101118.patch
  +1: rjung
  -0: markt - http://markmail.org/thread/777be426ulcfmdd3 suggests there may be
              a memory leak in this code somewhere. I'd like to get to the
              bottom of that before porting this
      rjung:  I started a discussion about JSPs and memory on the dev list.
              The updated patch fixes a race condition.
              We can stall this item until we get some feedback about 7.0.5.
      markt - r1172614 needs to be included in this proposal. With that patch,
              my testing shows that the unloading works as designed
