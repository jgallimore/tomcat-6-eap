RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:


PATCHES ACCEPTED TO BACKPORT:
  [ start all new proposals below, under PATCHES PROPOSED. ]

PATCHES PROPOSED TO BACKPORT:
  [ New proposals should be added at the end of the list ]

* Fix issue where the first request for a deleted JSPs returns as if the JSP
  still exists.
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=683969
  +1: markt, funkman
   0: remm (looks risky, very minor problem), fhanik - minor problem
  -1: 

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=45074
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=689402&view=rev
  +1: jfclere, funkman, fhanik
   0: markt: The OP was using linux so I assume they saw some benefit.
             If this is goign to be applied, the docs should be
             updated as well.
  -0: remm: configuring this is useless (esp on Windows, only the default behavior gives acceptable performance)
  -1: 

* Handle session suffix rewrite at JvmRouteBinderValve with parallel requests from same client
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=693378&view=rev
  +1: pero, fhanik, markt, jim
  -1: 

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=44382
  Use HttpOnly for session cookies. This is enabled by default. Feel free to
  caveat your vote with a preference for disabled by default.
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=694992&view=rev
  +1: mark (prefer enabled, happy with disabled), rjung
   0: remm (not so elegant, not sure about default value)
      markt It can be improved once the API is fixed in the 3.0 spec
      fhanik why did we change it in trunk to begin with if we are gonna change it again when the spec comes out
             lets just implement the spec in trunk, and discuss the simplest solution for 6.0.x
             but I don't agree with changing the default value
      funkman: leave as gap until 3.0 spec
  -1: 
  rjung: slightly prefer enabled for 6.0.x because of increased security by default,
         but disabled for tc5.5.x because of the small risk of breaking existing apps.

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=45026
  Never use empty reason phrase.
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=697183&view=rev
  +1: rjung, mturk, markt, jim
   0: remm (also affects to the two other AJP connectors)

* Allow huge request body packets for AJP13.
  This was already applied to connectors, but never
  carried forward to trunk and tc6.0.x.
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=697192&view=rev
  Original change: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=486217&view=rev
  +1: rjung, mturk, markt, pero, jim
   0: remm (also affects to the two other AJP connectors)

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=45403
  See commit message for details of negligable performance impact
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=701358&view=rev
  +1: markt, funkman
  -0: remm (I also do not think the patch is a good idea as a backport)
  -0: fhanik - the bug talks about WEB-INF/lib and reload, that would be when reload="true" which should be considered development only
      So to make this bug actually worth while fixing, and not impact performance, then it should only do this check on files that 
      are relevant to the reload of an application, in other words a watched resource

* Backport NCDFE fix from trunk (TCK failures without it)
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=640888&view=rev 
  +1: markt
  +1: fhanik - trivial change
   0: remm (no clue how it can cause a NCDF, and the TCK actually works for me; besides that code is 
            really old to me, so where would this come from ?)
  -1: 

* Changes required to run with a security manager
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=721286&view=rev
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=721704&view=rev
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=721708&view=rev
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=721886&view=rev
  +1: markt, fhanik
   0: billbarker: Haven't tried to break it yet, but the 4th patch potentially
      offers access to static fields in ELContextImpl and ELResolverImpl that could 
      possibly be exploited by a malicious webapp.
  -1: 

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=46351
  Build script re-factoring
  Patch provided by Marc Guillemot
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=729681&view=rev
  +1: markt, jim
   0: fhanik - not sure its needed in 6.0 branch if all is working with the old script
   0: funkman - ditto
  -1:
