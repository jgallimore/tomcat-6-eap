PATCHES PROPOSED TO BACKPORT:
  [ New proposals should be added at the end of the list ]

*  Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=36155
   Port the fix from the JK Connector to the AJP and APR Connectors
   http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=672454&view=rev
   +1: billbarker
   -1: remm: No, this gets called all the time, and we're trying to fix a small issue. The real
             solution would be to recycle the fields since as mentioned here it is the cause of 
             the problem (the "local" fields will often never change, but there's no real 
             guarantee overall - it mostly breaks down if there are multiple connectors, with AJP,
             and seems impossible to anticipate):
             https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=36155#c17

* Fix issue where the first request for a deleted JSPs returns as if the JSP
  still exists.
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=683969
  +1: markt
   0: remm (looks risky, very minor problem)
  -1: 

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=45608
  Prevent race condition for allocate/deallocate in StandardWrapper
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=685177&view=rev
  +1: markt
   0: remm: The only unsafe usage of this field is to implement the gimmick loop-wait hack,
            which to me means adding any sort of sync is not worth it.
  -1: 

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=45074
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=689402&view=rev
  +1: jfclere
   0: markt: The OP was using linux so I assume they saw some benefit.
             If this is goign to be applied, the docs should be
             updated as well.
  -0: remm: configuring this is useless (esp on Windows, only the default behavior gives acceptable performance)
  -1: 

* Handle session suffix rewrite at JvmRouteBinderValve with parallel requests from same client
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=693378&view=rev
  +1: pero, fhanik, markt
  -1: 

* Fix log a warning if we create maxThreads
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=694951&view=rev (JIO)
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=708195&view=rev (APR, NIO)
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=708223&view=rev (Change log level)
  +1: markt, fhanik
   0: remm (logging could pile up quickly)
      markt Because thread count only grows there will only ever be one log message
  -1: 

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=44382
  Use HttpOnly for session cookies. This is enabled by default. Feel free to
  caveat your vote with a preference for disabled by default.
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=694992&view=rev
  +1: mark (prefer enabled, happy with disabled), rjung
   0: remm (not so elegant, not sure about default value)
      markt It can be improved once the API is fixed in the 3.0 spec
      fhanik why did we change it in trunk to begin with if we are gonna change it again when the spec comes out
             lets just implement the spec in trunk, and discuss the simplest solution for 6.0.x
             but I don't agree with changing the default value
  -1: 
  rjung: slightly prefer enabled for 6.0.x because of increased security by default,
         but disabled for tc5.5.x because of the small risk of breaking existing apps.

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=45026
  Never use empty reason phrase.
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=697183&view=rev
  +1: rjung, mturk, markt
   0: remm (also affects to the two other AJP connectors)

* Allow huge request body packets for AJP13.
  This was already applied to connectors, but never
  carried forward to trunk and tc6.0.x.
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=697192&view=rev
  Original change: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=486217&view=rev
  +1: rjung, mturk, markt, pero
   0: remm (also affects to the two other AJP connectors)

* Fix serialisation issue reported by Find Bugs
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=699633&view=rev
  +1: markt
   0: remm (StdContext was marked as Serializable for an experiment; obviously it won't work)
  -1:

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=45933
  Don't use xml parser from web-app to process tld files
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=701355&view=rev
  +1: markt
  -0: remm (it is a refactoring, and is not appropriate to me in 6.0.x)
           markt - It is a refactoring but the refactoring was necessary
                   to change when TLDs were processed to avoid the bug. It
                   isn't refactoring for the sake of refactoring.

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=45403
  See commit message for details of negligable performance impact
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=701358&view=rev
  +1: markt
  -0: remm (I also do not think the patch is a good idea as a backport)

* Backport NCDFE fix from trunk (TCK failures without it)
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=640888&view=rev 
  +1: markt
   0: remm (no clue how it can cause a NCDF, and the TCK actually works for me; besides that code is 
            really old to me, so where would this come from ?)
  -1: 

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=46125
  Change the exception to cause a 400 status code if the request headers are too
  big
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=709811&view=rev
  +1: markt, remm (with a trivial improvement)
  -1: fhanik - InternalAprInputBuffer/InternalNioInputBuffer should provide the same behavior (+1 for same changes in all three)

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=41861
  Add major version number to Tomcat service name created by Windows installer
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=710066&view=rev
  +1: markt, rjung
  -1: 
  rjung: tomcat.nsi already uses replacement patterns like @VERSION@.
         So it might be more robust, to add another replacement like
         VERSION_MAJOR or VERSION_MAIN to dist.xml resolving
         to ${version.major} or $version.major}.${version.minor}
         and then replace all occurences of "6" with @VERSION_MAJOR@
         or @VERSION_MAIN@.
  rjung: Should be added to PR_DESCRIPTION in bin/service.bat as well.
         Just did that for trunk (r711934; but it contains also other changes).
         Caution: at the moment there's no @VERSION@ substitution for service.bat.

* Fix http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=712274&view=rev
  ReplicationValve can throw NPE as context doesn't exists! (Config as Engine level)
  +1: pero, fhanik, markt
  -1: 

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=42747
  Ensure context.xml takes effect on first deployment. Make processing of
  context.xml consistent.
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=712464&view=rev
  +1: markt, fhanik
   0: remm (risky, would it be possible to stop backporting risky changes and behavior modifications to 6.0.x ?)
  -1: 


* Add Costin's DBCP check so you can build Tomcat 6 on a 1.6 JDK
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=652744

  This is required as a result of my previous changes to HostConfig
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=718436&view=rev
  +1: markt, fhanik
   0: remm (risky, would it be possible to stop backporting risky changes and behavior modifications to 6.0.x ?)

  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=719628&view=rev
  +1: markt, fhanik
   0: remm (risky, would it be possible to stop backporting risky changes and behavior modifications to 6.0.x ?
      on this particular one, if people want fancy behavior, maybe they should use an executor)
  -1: 

* Prevent async close NPE on already closed sockets
  http://people.apache.org/~fhanik/tomcat/comet-close-2.patch
  +1: fhanik
  -1:
