                         Apache Tomcat 6.0 Patch Proposals
                         =================================


RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:


PATCHES ACCEPTED TO BACKPORT:
  [ start all new proposals below, under PATCHES PROPOSED. ]

PATCHES PROPOSED TO BACKPORT:
  [ New proposals should be added at the end of the list ]

* Fix issue where the first request for a deleted JSPs returns as if the JSP
  still exists.
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=683969
  +1: markt, funkman
   0: remm (looks risky, very minor problem), fhanik - minor problem, jim
  -1: 

* Backport cleanup of semantics of thisAccessedTime and
  lastAccessedTime for sessions:
  - preparational whitespace changes
    http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=711695&view=rev
  - Give thisAccessedTime and lastAccessedTime for sessions
    a clear semantics:
    http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=711711&view=rev
    - thisAccessedTime will be updated at the beginning and
      at the end of session use
    - lastAccessedTime will only be updated at the end of
      session use
    This means:
    - lastAccessedTime is the last access time of a session
      disregarding any request still being processed on.
      So this is good to use even from within a request
      to detect when its own session has been used last before.
    - thisAccessedTime already gets updated when a new request 
      disregarding any request still being processed on.
      So this is better for any idleness check or information.
    - thisAccessedTime >= lastAccessedTime always
  - Port from StandardSession to DeltaSession
    http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=711714&view=rev
  - Expose thisAccessedTime via the session interface
    and ManagerBase, so we can use it from outside the session.
    http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=711716&view=rev
  - Make the classes checking session idleness use thisAccessedTime.
    http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=711720&view=rev
    This is not for invalidation, only for displaying
    idle times and making persistance decisions.
  +1: rjung
   0: billbarker: generally agree with remm that this is too big of a change for the stable branch
                 but could agree to some of it if it was split into parts
   0: markt: Agree with Bill - smaller parts would be better
  -1: remm: no for TC 6.0
  -1: funkman : api change in Session.java for .x.x release

  JAAS LoginContext expects a call to logout()
  +1: markt, jim
  -1: 
 
* Improve NIO connector shutdown time by doing shutdowns in parallel
  and with a timeout
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=791914
  +1: fhanik, markt, kkolinko, jim
  -1: 
  kkolinko: (
    Some nit-picking:
    1. I think that it is better to create the stopLatch in the NioEndpoint#start()
    method right before the array of Pollers is created, instead of NioEndpoint#init().
    And to pass a reference to it to the Poller (as an argument in Poller
    constructor).
    That is because otherwise if you call stop() start() the stopLatch won't be in
    its initial condition, and because the count of pollers can be changed between
    init() and start(). Just a theory, though.
    
    2. In NioEndpoint.Poller#run():
    - if the Poller was looping with paused=true, is there a need to call
    events() before exiting the loop on if (close) ?
    - there are several ways to exit the loop: two if(close), one while
     (running), and may be exceptions. The first if(close) does not call
     selector.close(). And if you exit because of running = false there is
     no call to timeout(0, false); and selector.close().
    - there is special processing code for OutOfMemoryError, but inside the
     loop, and in events() method, you catch any Throwable.
    - it would be better to put stopLatch.countDown() inside a finally{} block
    3. In NioEndpoint.Poller#destroy() there is comment ("// Wait...").
    Is it still relevant? I do not see any waiting there.
  )

* Port TLD processing improvements from trunk
  There have been quite a few changes to TLD processing and they are tightly
  coupled. Therefore, this proposal is a series of patches and the patches
  need to be applied in order. Even then the patches do not apply completely
  cleanly so a rolled up patch has been provided at each stage.
  Note: The JSP TCK passes with the full set of patches applied.
  The benefit is twofold. First a number of edge case bugs I came across are
  fixed. The short version is that the Catalina code and the Jasper code did
  things differently. As well as the inherent inconsistencies (and hence bugs)
  this created it also made it much harder to add the additional functionality
  I was trying to add for embeddability. Which brings me to the second benefit.
  With these fixes in place, the changes I was trying to make (patch to follow
  when I have done more testing) for embeddability become possible.
  Step 1: Clean-up

  Step 4: Sync Catalina and Jasper code so a) they have the same behaviour and
  b) use the same code so they are easier to keep in sync.

* Allow per instance log4j.properties, JAR files (JDBC drivers) etc
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=810916&view=rev
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=810977&view=rev
  +1: markt, rjung, fhanik, kkolinko
  -1:
  kkolinko: A side effect of this change will be that when catalina.home
  and catalina.base are the same, all the jar files will be listed twice.
  I doubt that it will cause any issues (reading the same jar file twice
  should be possible, and should not cause any additional locking or
  whatever, though wasting resources).
  An alternative would be to document this option and to instruct people to
  modify catalina.properties,  or we can guard against duplicate URLs in
  o.a.c.startup.ClassLoaderFactory


* Allow per instance configuration of JULI or log4j for core Tomcat logging
  This requires the classpath change above
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=810976&view=rev
  +1: markt, rjung, fhanik
  -1: kkolinko: we should not remove tomcat-juli.jar from bootstrap.jar.manifest

  rjung: I think you have to switch HOME and BASE in the following changed
  lines in logging.xml:
    +      If you have multiple instances of Tomcat, each with a separate
    +      <code>$CATALINA_HOME</code> but a shared <code>$CATALINA_BASE</code> then
  kkolinko: in logging.xml:
    +   Note that you may need to create a
    +      <code>$CATALINA_BASE/lib</code> directory. 
    I think that $CATALINA_BASE/bin is also to be mentioned as one you may
    need to create. Though it is mentioned in RUNNING.txt, it is a recent
    addition and I do not think that all configurations have it.
  kkolinko: Regarding /res/bootstrap.jar.manifest change:
    It will cause problems e.g. in Eclipse IDE.
    If I configure a Tomcat server instance there, it is created with a
    classpath that consists only of bootstrap.jar and JDK's tools.jar. That
    has to be changed to include tomcat-juli.jar as well.
    While that is configurable, it is not so obvious (you have to click
    some underlined text on some wordy page) and there can be a lot of
    confusion when the product ceases functioning out-of-the box.

    I also like that I can run Tomcat easily by typing "java -jar bootstrap.jar start"
    That option will also be lost.

    I think that we can implement the same feature by adding
    ${CATALINA_BASE}/bin/tomcat-juli.jar to the classpath before
    bootstrap.jar   We can propose people to manually remove
    tomcat-juli.jar from ${CATALINA_HOME}/bin if they want, though I doubt
    that that will be necessary.

  Adds support for SSL renegotiation when CLIENT-CERT auth is required due to a
  security constraint
  Note: Patch cannot be applied until tc-native 1.1.17 has been released
        since it depends on a new native method

* Fix for https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=47161
  Correctly report thread counts when using executors
  https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/attachment.cgi?id=24272
  +1: markt, rjung
  -1: fhanik - this creates a package dependency we've been avoiding so far. Its not the connectors job to report thread count if an executor is used.
  rjung: Maybe we should add a few getters to org.apache.catalina.Executor
  for TC 7, so we can assume everyone providing an implementation
  allows us to query? If they don't use threads, they can return -1 or whatever.

* Align native and Java method names.
  Port/backport from trunk, TC5.5.x, tc4.1.x and tcnative (trunk and 1.1.x)
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=815748&view=rev

  +1: rjung, markt
  -1: 
  rjung: Note that java/org/apache/tomcat/jni/Buffer.java
  is missing in TC 6. Don't know, whether we should add it.
  It is in 5.5, trunk and tcnative 1.1.
  markt: Happy either way with slight preference for adding it

  rjung: Our dreaded multi platform build system is a bit fragile
  w.r.t. fixcrlf. If you change the file to crlf in the installer
  target, then all unix packages (which are build after installer)
  will also contain it in crlf format. Not to bad for especially
  that file (because part of a webapp), but maybe it would
  be cleaner to do this for the installer target only, e.g.
  saving the file, fixcrlf, run nsi, restoring file.
  kkolinko: Another way to fix it would be to place a copy of that file
  into %CATALINA_HOME% (with proper CRLF endings) and display that one in
  the installer, leaving the one in the ROOT webapp as is. Note, that we
  already have these two copies of the file in our zip/tgz distributions.

  Don't swallow BindException

  -1: 

* Fix cluster replication problem: session expiration uses a replication
  shortcut, so that attributes changed immediately before invalidation do
  not get replicated before the expiration replication message.
  That's a problem in case a session listener needs the changed attribute.
  Has already been fixed in trunk, OACC and tc5.5.x.
