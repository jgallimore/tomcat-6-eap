PATCHES PROPOSED TO BACKPORT:
  [ New proposals should be added at the end of the list ]


* Add ManagerBase session getLastAccessedTimestamp and getCreationTimestamp for better
  remote JMX access.
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=612971&view=rev
  +1: pero, rjung, fhanik, markt
  -1: remm: I believe it would need specific support for certain managers. Interested users
            could use their own extended manager instead.

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=44595
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=645428
  +1: jfclere, rjung, fhanik, remm, pero

  Use correct location for endorsed dir

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=45015
  You can't use an unescaped quote if you quote the value with that character
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=657231&view=rev
  +1: markt
  -1: remm (I think it is a good patch, but it throws an error for something which was working before,
            so I would think keeping it for the next release would be better)
      markt How about making it optional with a system property that can be used
            to restore the current behaviour is an app depends on it?

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=44994
  Correct BNF grammar so ${0 lt a ? 1 lt a ? "many": "one": "none"} works
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=657404&view=rev
  Note patch is larger than strictly necessary due to autogenerated code
  +1: markt, yoavs, remm
  -1: 

* Additional patch from https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=43094
  Allow configuration of JSSE providers
  Based on a patch by Bruno Harbulot
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=657449&view=rev
  +1: markt, yoavs, remm

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=42750
  Make parsing of request line more tolerant of multiple SP and/or HT
  Note: This is on the critical path
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=657954&view=rev
  +1: markt
  -1: remm (the library causing this bug cannot possibly have read the little
            hidden, optional appendix from the HTTP/1.0 spec, and rely on it, so it is simply broken;
            it may not apply to HTTP/1.1, which may be more strict; passing full URLs in the
            request line is normally an HTTP/1.1 thing, from what I remember, usable as an alternative
            to the mandatory Host header)
      markt Both the HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/1.0 contain broadly the same text
            regarding tolerant applications. (ie allow multiple SP/HT between
            method-url and url-httpVersion). However, it is optional so we don't
            have to support it.

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=42747
  Use any META-INF/context.xml in a consistent manner and ensure it is used on
  initial deployment
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=657995&view=rev
  +1: markt
  -1: remm (would need convincing that this is really well tested, otherwise delay to next release)
      markt Exactly what would convince you that this was well tested above and
            beyond the local testing that I have done to convince myself that
            this patch does what I want it to.
