                         Apache Tomcat 6.0 Patch Proposals
                         =================================


RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:


PATCHES ACCEPTED TO BACKPORT:
  [ start all new proposals below, under PATCHES PROPOSED. ]

PATCHES PROPOSED TO BACKPORT:
  [ New proposals should be added at the end of the list ]

* Fix autodeployment of applications that have configuration errors.
  If autodeployment fails, create DeployedApplication object and register
  what we deployed (xml or war or dir - a single file) as redeployResource.
  If it is updated the application will be redeployed.
  + ContainerBase patch adds display of failed apps in manager. They can be
  listed and undeployed.

  http://people.apache.org/~kkolinko/patches/2011-11-14_tc6_ContainerBase.patch
  +1: kkolinko
  +0: kfujino: Question of if host.addChild(context) threw IllegalStateException.
      E.g. case of deployDirectory.
      If META-INF/context.xml exist in Directory, context.xml is copied to configBase.
      If host.addChild(context) threw IllegalStateException, only a directory is 
      registered into redeployResources. Context.xml does not register into redeployResources.
      If manager app execute undeploy(or delete directory), directory is deleted 
      but context.xml isn't deleted.
      Should (conf/Catalina/localhost/)context.xml be registered into redeployResources? 
      Or need to delete context.xml manually?

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=52579
  Propose new implementation of ByteChunk.toStringInternal().
  This fix does not reintroduce issue BZ51400.
  This fix avoids http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6196991.

* https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=52811
  Fix parsing of Content-Type
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=1300154&view=rev (new HTTP header parser)
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=1300155&view=rev (the actual fix)
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=1304275&view=rev (case insensitivity)
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=1304895&view=rev (case insensitivity)
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=1345752&view=rev (BZ 53353)
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=1345754&view=rev (BZ 53353)
  (=r1300157+r1300161+r1304897+1345755 in TC7)
  +1: markt
   0: fhanik - introducing a new parser this late into a release seems too risky for 6
  +0: kkolinko:
        Maybe there can be a simpler, not spec-imposing solution for 6.0?
        E.g. disable parsing and appending of charset if
        contentType.indexOf('\"') >= 0.
        A good note about original proposal is that it does not affect
        request parsing, so only broken webapps may break, not broken clients.

* Fix bug https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=52858
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=1300948&view=rev
  +1: fhanik, markt, rjung
  -1:
  rjung: Isn't this only fixing the regression introduced by 52858 (BZ 53138)
  but 52858 will be again unfixed?
  -1: kkolinko: unless r1340218 is backported as well (I agree with rjung's
      concern). Proposed below.

 Additional patch:
  kkolinko: Regarding r1340218: Note, that "reg" argument in all existing
  calls to processSendfile() is always true. The actual change in this
  revision is registering for OP_WRITE regardless of the value of
  attachment.interestOps()
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1340218 (fix BZ 53138)
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1342468 (cleanup)

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=52918
  Add WebSocket support to Tomcat 6
  +1: fhanik

* Backport UserDataHelper class (issue 52184)
  Provide greater control over the logging of errors triggered by invalid
  input data (i.e. data over which Tomcat has no control).

  Note: cookies logging (o.a.t.util.http.Cookies) does not need to be
  addressed in Tomcat 6, because all logging in that class here is done at
  debug level.

  http://people.apache.org/~kkolinko/patches/2012-03-26_tc6_UserDataHelper.patch
  (includes a new file, copied from trunk:
  svn cp ../../trunk/java/org/apache/tomcat/util/log/UserDataHelper.java@1242371 java/org/apache/tomcat/util/log/UserDataHelper.java
  )

* For https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=52055
  Ensure that filters are recycled.
  Inspired by r1334790 (TC7), r565964 (TC6 Nio)
  I do not have evidence that this change matters, but it should not hurt.
  The nextRequest() method already recycles the filters. If it has been called,
  then lastActiveFilter is -1 and the new code will be NOOP.

  Allow database realms configured with an all roles mode that is authentication
  only to not have to define a role table

  +1: markt, kfujino

       at least set required="false" on roleNameCol, userRoleTable
       in config/realm.html)

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=53071
  Use the message from the Throwable for the error report if none was specified
  via sendError()

PATCHES/ISSUES THAT ARE STALLED

* Backport JSP unloading patch (BZ48358).
  The patch has substantially changed since the original version.
  Original revisions are: 937787, 1028377, 1028389, 1028396, 1028861, 1028862, 1028863,
  1028935, 1028939, 1028940, 1028944, 1028950, 1030014, 1030037
  Combined TC 6 patch:
  http://people.apache.org/~rjung/patches/BZ48358-JSP_Unloading-TC6_20101118.patch
  +1: rjung
  -0: markt - http://markmail.org/thread/777be426ulcfmdd3 suggests there may be
              a memory leak in this code somewhere. I'd like to get to the
              bottom of that before porting this
      rjung:  I started a discussion about JSPs and memory on the dev list.
              The updated patch fixes a race condition.
              We can stall this item until we get some feedback about 7.0.5.
      markt - r1172614 needs to be included in this proposal. With that patch,
              my testing shows that the unloading works as designed
