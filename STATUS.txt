                         Apache Tomcat 6.0 Patch Proposals
                         =================================


RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:


PATCHES ACCEPTED TO BACKPORT:
  [ start all new proposals below, under PATCHES PROPOSED. ]

PATCHES PROPOSED TO BACKPORT:
  [ New proposals should be added at the end of the list ]

* Fix the maven stuff for the maven repo.
  Before it does't find tomcat-juli.jar and the remoteRepository seems broken .
  http://people.apache.org/~jfclere/patches/maven.patch.100711
  +1: jfclere
  -1: fhanik - easier to pass in the root path (lib/bin) to the macro instead of hacking around it
               if we remove the SCP auto feature, then there should be something to replace it with
               (http://ant.apache.org/manual/OptionalTasks/scp.html)
  +1: kkolinko: +1 for the updated patch (maven.patch.100711)
      I still think that it is not so good to remove the old code of <remoteRepository/>,
      because it ignores ${maven.repo.url} parameter provided by deploy-snapshot,
      deploy-staging and deploy-release targets. Maybe leave old code as a comment
      and fix it later if needed? I think that actually nobody besides the release manager
      uses this, so I am letting this pass.

* Expose the new WebappLoader flag in the VirtualWebappLoader,
  but allow alternative name searchVirtualFirst to make it
  consistent with the "virtual" terminology.
  Now you can decide, whether the virtual paths will
  be searched before the webapp or after it.
  If searched before, external resources take precendence
  over internal ones. Before that change one couldn't overwrite
  resources already present in the webapp.

  http://people.apache.org/~rjung/patches/2010-05-14-loader-backport-r936825.patch
  +1: rjung, funkman

  -0: kkolinko: The patch itself is OK, but I think having a synonym will
   cause confusion. I'd prefer not to invent a new name, but mention the
   one that we already have when documenting virtualClasspath.

* Fix path parameter handling. Currently the following URL fails with a 404:
  http://localhost:8080/examples/jsp/snp;x=y/snoop.jsp
  http://people.apache.org/~kkolinko/patches/2010-11-17_tc6_path-params.patch
  +1: kkolinko, markt, schultz
  -1:

   kkolinko: The old parseSessionId() method calls "clearRequestedSessionURL(request);"
     when there is no sessionid in the path. The new code does not do that. Was that
     call needed? It looks that it was not needed, but I might miss something.

   kkolinko: Discussed in Re:r1005192 thread on dev@


* Backport JSP unloading patch (BZ48358).
  The patch has substantially changed since the original version.
  Original revisions are: 937787, 1028377, 1028389, 1028396, 1028861, 1028862, 1028863,
  1028935, 1028939, 1028940, 1028944, 1028950, 1030014, 1030037
  Combined TC 6 patch:
  http://people.apache.org/~rjung/patches/BZ48358-JSP_Unloading-TC6_20101118.patch
  +1: rjung
  -0: markt - http://markmail.org/thread/777be426ulcfmdd3 suggests there may be
              a memory leak in this code somewhere. I'd like to get to the
              bottom of that before porting this
      rjung:  I started a discussion about JSPs and memory on the dev list.
              The updated patch fixes a race condition.
              We can stall this item until we get some feedback about 7.0.5.
  -1:

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=50771
  Ensure HttpServletRequest#getAuthType() returns the name of the authentication scheme 
  if request has already been authenticated.
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1070409
  https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/attachment.cgi?id=26649 (patch against tc6.0)
  +1: kfujino, markt

* Add additional configuration options to the DIGEST authenticator
  http://people.apache.org/~markt/patches/2011-04-01-digest-tc6.patch
  +1: markt
  +1: schultz : if s/nOnce/nonce/g for the whole file, not just some of it
  -1:

* Backport exception logging from revision 1090022
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1090022
  +1: schultz
  +1: kkolinko, jung: +1, but I think it is better to combine this with r1073393
      (http://markmail.org/message/vkao3gcwe2w63jxj)
  -1:

* Add StuckThreadDetectionValve
  https://github.com/sylvainlaurent/tomcat60/commit/252334f958877221ecb2dc64ee0fd12bb77e360b
  +1: slaurent
  +1: kkolinko: several comments are below
  -1:
  kkolinko: To view/download this as a patch file you add ".diff" to the URL above. That is:
  https://github.com/sylvainlaurent/tomcat60/commit/252334f958877221ecb2dc64ee0fd12bb77e360b.diff

  kkolinko: Minor glitches:
    - In mbeans-descriptors.xml:
      - There are no properties "asyncSupported", "stateName" in TC6 version of this valve.
    - In valve.xml:
      - s/tomcat log/Tomcat log/ (or Apache Tomcat log)
    - In StuckThreadDetectionValve.java:
      - s/private class CompletedStuckThread/private static class CompletedStuckThread/
        MonitoredThread can be made static as well.
      - result[i] = idList.get(i); and arguments to sm.getString()
        I'd prefer the boxing/unboxing conversion to be coded explicitly.
      - s/new Long(/Long.valueOf(/
      - ConcurrentHashMap: Maybe the defaults could be tuned with system properties.
        I wonder whether ConcurrentHashMap.DEFAULT_CONCURRENCY_LEVEL which is 16 is enough.
      - getStuckThreadIds() returns a list of ids. It might be useful to
        have a similar method that returns Thread.getName() names.

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=51220
  Add a system property to enable tag pooling with JSPs that use a custom base
  class.
  Based on a patch by Dan Mikusa.

            2.2 of RFC 2616 must be quoted to be used within a parameter value.

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=36362

* Multiple improvements to the Windows Installer
  - https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=33262
    Install monitor to auto-start for current user only rather than all users to
    be consistent with menu item creation.
  - Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=40510
    Provide an option to install shortcuts for the current user or all users.
    Also ensure registry is correctly cleaned on uninstall for 64-bit platforms.
  - Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=50949
    Provide the ability to specify the AJP port and service name when installing
    Tomcat using the Windows installer. This permits multiple instances of the
    same Tomcat version to be installed side-by-side.
  - Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=51135
    Fix auto-detection of JAVA_HOME for 64-bit Windows platforms that only have
    a 32-bit JVM installed.
  http://people.apache.org/~markt/patches/2011-06-24-windows-installer-multiple-tc6.patch
  plus addition of http://people.apache.org/~markt/patches/2011-06-24-windows-installer-multiple-tc6.server_3.xml

* Notifications of changes in session ID to other nodes in the cluster should be
  controlled by notifySessionListenersOnReplication rather than
  notifyListenersOnReplication.
