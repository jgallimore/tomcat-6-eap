                         Apache Tomcat 6.0 Patch Proposals
                         =================================


RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:

None


PATCHES PROPOSED TO BACKPORT:
  [ New proposals should be added at the end of the list ]

* Use JSSESocketFactory.filterInsecureProtocols instead of duplicate
  implementation of the same code.
  http://people.apache.org/~schultz/patches/coalesce-protocol-filtering.tc6.patch
  (Not a back-port. No functional change.)
  Also corrects spelling of filterInsecureProtocols method.
+1: schultz, kkolinko
+0: markt: Should fix BZ57234 at the same time  kkolinko: Updated patch is proposed below.
-1:

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=57234
  Make SSL protocol filtering to remove insecure protocols case
  insensitive. Correct spelling of filterInsecureProtocols method.
  This is
   - Backport of r1641377
   - + patch by Christopher Schultz to de-duplicate code and correct
   spelling of filterInsecureProtocols method
   - Fix a pair of compiler warnings in JSSESocketFactory.java
    (fix duplicate ';' and use generics in declaration of a local variable).
  https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/attachment.cgi?id=32226
  +1: kkolinko, remm, rjung
  +1: schultz, and I withdraw above proposal if this one is accepted
  -1:

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=54143
  1. Add display of memory pools usage (including PermGen) to the Status page
  of the Manager web application.
  
  2. Fix several issues with <code>status.xsd</code> schema in Manager web
  application, testing it against actual output of StatusTransformer
  class. Add the new <memorypool/> element to the schema.

  To test the schema, one can save output of /manager/status?XML=true command and
  add the following attributes to the root <status> element:

    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="status.xsd"

  This fixes the following schema issues:
  1) Remove minSpareThreads, maxSpareThreads attributes from schema and XSLT.

  StatusTransformer does not generate them on threadInfo element.

  2) Correct cardinality of <worker/> and <connector/> elements.

  There are 0..inf workers, 1..inf connectors.

  (In theory there are 0..inf connectors, but if one can access the manager
  app then at least one connector is running)

  3) Correct misspelled attribute name, recieved->received.

  There are several code paths in StatusTransformer and one generated
  misspelled name, while others used the correct one. Fixed the java code
  and schema.

  4) Add the new <memorypool/> element to the schema.

  Backport of r1409014, r1453106, r1453119, r1348992 from tomcat/tc7.0.x/trunk.

  Justification:
    To be able to monitor PermGen. The necessary APIs (MemoryPoolMXBean)
    are available since Java 5.

  -1:

* Add addConnectorPort() to RemoteAddrValve and RemoteHostValve.
  Partial backports of r1642564,1642606 (trunk) resp.  r1643513,1643539 (tc8)
  resp. r1643515,1643540 (tc7).

PATCHES/ISSUES THAT ARE STALLED:

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=44312
  Log an error if there is a conflict between Host and Alias names.
  Improve host management methods in Mapper to avoid occasionally removing
  a wrong host. Check that host management operations are performed on
  the host and not on an alias.
  1) https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/attachment.cgi?id=31744
  2) http://svn.apache.org/r1608653
  3) http://svn.apache.org/r1608833
  4) TestMapper changes from http://svn.apache.org/r1608831
  +1: kkolinko, remm
  -1:
   kkolinko: Good for occasional review, but as backporting r1608833 won't
   be trivial I'd have to update the patch.
