* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=45015
  You can't use an unescaped quote if you quote the value with that character

  -1: remm (I think it is a good patch, but it throws an error for something which was working before,
            so I would think keeping it for the next release would be better)
      markt How about making it optional with a system property that can be used
            to restore the current behaviour is an app depends on it?
      remm Ok with this addition, but I would only vote +0 for inclusion in this release
           (this still sounds like a very minor fix)

* Enhancement https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=45155
  Provide a workaround to a buggy MS WebDAV client.

* Provide belt and braces XSS protection. Really an app responsbility but worth
  protecting against in case the app forgets.

* Make fix for https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=43285 optional
  Coercion of null and "" to zero can now be disabled if required

  +1: fhanik - candidate for STRICT_SERVLET_COMPLIANCE?
      markt  - Probably not. STRICT_SERVLET_COMPLIANCE is a shortcut to set all
               options that are non-compliant by default. This one is already
               compliant by defult

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=45195
  NPE when calling getAttribute(null). The spec is unclear but this
  is a regression from 5.0.x

* Another fix for https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=43683
  JMX re-registration was causing the context to briefly disappear from the
