                         Apache Tomcat 6.0 Patch Proposals
                         =================================


RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:


PATCHES ACCEPTED TO BACKPORT:
  [ start all new proposals below, under PATCHES PROPOSED. ]

PATCHES PROPOSED TO BACKPORT:
  [ New proposals should be added at the end of the list ]

* Fix issue where the first request for a deleted JSPs returns as if the JSP
  still exists.
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=683969
  +1: markt, funkman
   0: remm (looks risky, very minor problem), fhanik - minor problem, jim
  -1: 

* Backport cleanup of semantics of thisAccessedTime and
  lastAccessedTime for sessions:
  - preparational whitespace changes
    http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=711695&view=rev
  - Give thisAccessedTime and lastAccessedTime for sessions
    a clear semantics:
    http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=711711&view=rev
    - thisAccessedTime will be updated at the beginning and
      at the end of session use
    - lastAccessedTime will only be updated at the end of
      session use
    This means:
    - lastAccessedTime is the last access time of a session
      disregarding any request still being processed on.
      So this is good to use even from within a request
      to detect when its own session has been used last before.
    - thisAccessedTime already gets updated when a new request 
      disregarding any request still being processed on.
      So this is better for any idleness check or information.
    - thisAccessedTime >= lastAccessedTime always
  - Port from StandardSession to DeltaSession
    http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=711714&view=rev
  - Expose thisAccessedTime via the session interface
    and ManagerBase, so we can use it from outside the session.
    http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=711716&view=rev
  - Make the classes checking session idleness use thisAccessedTime.
    http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=711720&view=rev
    This is not for invalidation, only for displaying
    idle times and making persistance decisions.

   0: billbarker: generally agree with remm that this is too big of a change for the stable branch
                 but could agree to some of it if it was split into parts
   0: markt: Agree with Bill - smaller parts would be better
  -1: remm: no for TC 6.0

  JAAS LoginContext expects a call to logout()

* Improve NIO connector shutdown time by doing shutdowns in parallel
  and with a timeout
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=791914
  +1: fhanik, markt, kkolinko, jim
  -1: 
  kkolinko: (
    Some nit-picking:
    1. I think that it is better to create the stopLatch in the NioEndpoint#start()
    method right before the array of Pollers is created, instead of NioEndpoint#init().
    And to pass a reference to it to the Poller (as an argument in Poller
    constructor).
    That is because otherwise if you call stop() start() the stopLatch won't be in
    its initial condition, and because the count of pollers can be changed between
    init() and start(). Just a theory, though.
    
    2. In NioEndpoint.Poller#run():
    - if the Poller was looping with paused=true, is there a need to call
    events() before exiting the loop on if (close) ?
    - there are several ways to exit the loop: two if(close), one while
     (running), and may be exceptions. The first if(close) does not call
     selector.close(). And if you exit because of running = false there is
     no call to timeout(0, false); and selector.close().
    - there is special processing code for OutOfMemoryError, but inside the
     loop, and in events() method, you catch any Throwable.
    - it would be better to put stopLatch.countDown() inside a finally{} block
    3. In NioEndpoint.Poller#destroy() there is comment ("// Wait...").
    Is it still relevant? I do not see any waiting there.
  )

* Port TLD processing improvements from trunk
  There have been quite a few changes to TLD processing and they are tightly
  coupled. Therefore, this proposal is a series of patches and the patches
  need to be applied in order. Even then the patches do not apply completely
  cleanly so a rolled up patch has been provided at each stage.
  Note: The JSP TCK passes with the full set of patches applied.
  The benefit is twofold. First a number of edge case bugs I came across are
  fixed. The short version is that the Catalina code and the Jasper code did
  things differently. As well as the inherent inconsistencies (and hence bugs)
  this created it also made it much harder to add the additional functionality
  I was trying to add for embeddability. Which brings me to the second benefit.
  With these fixes in place, the changes I was trying to make (patch to follow
  when I have done more testing) for embeddability become possible.

  +1: markt
  -1: 
  Step 4: Sync Catalina and Jasper code so a) they have the same behaviour and
  b) use the same code so they are easier to keep in sync.
