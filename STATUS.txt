                         Apache Tomcat 6.0 Patch Proposals
                         =================================


RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:


PATCHES ACCEPTED TO BACKPORT:
  [ start all new proposals below, under PATCHES PROPOSED. ]

PATCHES PROPOSED TO BACKPORT:
  [ New proposals should be added at the end of the list ]

* Fix the maven stuff for the maven repo.
  Before it does't find tomcat-juli.jar and the remoteRepository seems broken .
  http://people.apache.org/~jfclere/patches/maven.patch.100711
  +1: jfclere
  -1: fhanik - easier to pass in the root path (lib/bin) to the macro instead of hacking around it
               if we remove the SCP auto feature, then there should be something to replace it with
               (http://ant.apache.org/manual/OptionalTasks/scp.html)
  +1: kkolinko: +1 for the updated patch (maven.patch.100711)
      I still think that it is not so good to remove the old code of <remoteRepository/>,
      because it ignores ${maven.repo.url} parameter provided by deploy-snapshot,
      deploy-staging and deploy-release targets. Maybe leave old code as a comment
      and fix it later if needed? I think that actually nobody besides the release manager
      uses this, so I am letting this pass.

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=48545
  Truststores don't have to have passwords
  Based on a patch by 'smmwpf54'
  https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/attachment.cgi?id=25848

  Comments on previous patch
    jfclere: Doc says it should use keystorePass (http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-6.0-doc/config/http.html).
               so that would break existing configurations.
      markt: It shouldn't break existing configs. JSSE allows trust stores to be
             read without providing the password
      kkolinko: 1. My understanding of KeyStore.load(stream,pwd) doc is that when the
             password is not needed to open a store, it is used to verify its integrity.
             So, this patch changes behaviour: skips the verification.
             2. Note, that the password might be provided by overriding the
             getKeystorePassword() method. There is no way to provide such password
             for the truststore in the new code.
             3. I would be fine if this new behaviour in TC6 were triggered by some
             system property, but defaults to the old behaviour.


* Configure Tomcat to use HttpOnly for session cookies by default
  http://people.apache.org/~kkolinko/patches/2010-04-21_tc6_context_httpOnly.patch
  +1: kkolinko
  -0: markt - There wasn't consensus previously.
            - If you are going to change the default, do it in the code
  -1:

* Expose the new WebappLoader flag in the VirtualWebappLoader,
  but allow alternative name searchVirtualFirst to make it
  consistent with the "virtual" terminology.
  Now you can decide, whether the virtual paths will
  be searched before the webapp or after it.
  If searched before, external resources take precendence
  over internal ones. Before that change one couldn't overwrite
  resources already present in the webapp.
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=936825
  http://people.apache.org/~rjung/patches/2010-05-14-loader-backport-r936825.patch
  +1: rjung
  -1:
  -0: kkolinko: The patch itself is OK, but I think having a synonym will
   cause confusion. I'd prefer not to invent a new name, but mention the
   one that we already have when documenting virtualClasspath.

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=49099
  Provide a mechanism for including requests rejected by the CoyoteAdapter in
  the standard access log
  http://people.apache.org/~markt/patches/2010-07-07-bug49099.patch
  This is a backport of: r950587, r950809, r951018, r951093, r951447,
                         r951892, r952295

* Backport the CSRF prevention filter to Tomcat 6 and configure the Manager and
  Host Manager applications to use it. The configuration is such that the using
  the old roles (manager, admin) will work and will bypass the CSRF protection
  but using the new roles (manager-gui, admin-gui etc.) will not bypass the CSRF
  protection.

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=49217
  Ensure EL identifiers conform to the Java Language Specification with an
  option to disable this check.
  https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/attachment.cgi?id=25727
  +1: markt
  +1: kkolinko (if doc part is adjusted to the code)
  -1:
   kkolinko: doc says the SKIP_* property defaults to false, but in the code the
    default is true. (Maybe tie it to STRICT_SERVLET_COMPLIANCE?)
    Maybe document this in the "Specification" part of the systemprops.xml,
    instead of "Expression Language" as done in 7.0.2?

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=49555
  Correctly handle tag libraries that use functions defined in static inner
  classes
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=961948&view=rev
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=963106&view=rev
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=966863&view=rev
  +1: markt, kkolinko
  -1:
   kkolinko: I was worried that ELFunctionMapper$PrivilegedGetTccl
   should be preloaded in o.a.jasper.security.SecurityClassLoad,
   but from debugging it looks that it is called by Tomcat code only
   (JspServlet).

* Make sure Contexts defined in server.xml pick up any configClass setting from
  the parent Host.
  http://people.apache.org/~markt/patches/2010-09-11-configClass.patch
  +1: markt
  -1:
   kkolinko: A bit hard to understand. The proposal is about a rule that processes
    <Context>, but LifecycleListenerRule is used for <Engine> and <Host> as well.

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=49924
  When non-primary node changes into a primary node,
  make sure isPrimarySession is changed to true.

  +1: kfujino, markt
  -1:
   kkolinko: I think getMapOwner().objectMadePrimay(key, entry.getValue()); can
    throw an NPE. Can the mapOwner be null?
     kfujino : mapOwner is specified by the argument of the constructor of AbstractReplicatedMap.
       LazyReplicatedMap is constructed  specifying "this" in BackupManager#startInternal().
       Therefore, I think mapOwner can not be null.
     kkolinko: LazyReplicatedMap is constructed  specifying "null" in o.a.c.tribes.demos.MapDemo
       The other call to objectMadePrimay() (in AbstractReplicatedMap.memberDisappeared(..)) checks for null:
         if ( mapOwner!=null ) mapOwner.objectMadePrimay(entry.getKey(),entry.getValue());
     kfujino: I see, I'll add check for null.

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=49209
  Prevent possible AccessControlException during undeployment when running with
  a security manager

  Stop accepting new requests (inc keep-alive) once the BIO connector is paused
  and the current request has finished processing

  +1: markt

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=49625
  Ensure Vary header is set if response may be compressed rather than only
  setting it if it is compressed.
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=1002133&view=rev
  (patch needs to be applied separately to BIO, NIO and APR HTTP connectors)
