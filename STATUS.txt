RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:

None


PATCHES PROPOSED TO BACKPORT:
  [ New proposals should be added at the end of the list ]

* Make the xmlBlockExternal option in Catalina and Jasper to be true by default.
  https://people.apache.org/~kkolinko/patches/2014-02-17_tc6_xmlBlockExternalTrue.patch
  (backport of r1564747)
  +1: kkolinko, markt, remm
  -1:

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=56208
  Restore validateXml option in Jasper.
  Motivation: It is mentioned in documentation and some users complained on
  removal of this option in Tomcat 7, as that broke their build scripts.
  (The r1564747 backport proposal above have to be applied first, as it
  modified adjacent lines to this one)
  http://svn.apache.org/r1570163
  +1: kkolinko, markt, remm
  -1:

* Don't log to standard out in SSLValve.
  Simplify: s/new String("xxx")/"xxx"/
  http://svn.apache.org/r1081118
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/tomcat/trunk/java/org/apache/catalina/valves/SSLValve.java?r1=1041511&r2=1041510&pathrev=1041511
  +1: kkolinko, markt, remm
  -1:

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=56010
  Allow to use JspWriter.DEFAULT_BUFFER constant with
  JspFactory.getPageContext API.

* Improve processing of chuck size from chunked headers. Avoid overflow and use
  a bit shift instead of a multiplication as it is marginally faster.

  kkolinko: Technical notes:
    1. r1578329 does not belong to svn:mergeinfo, that is an unrelated commit
    2. changelog.xml part of the patch does not merge, because of later changes

* Redefine the <code>globalXsltFile</code> initialisation parameter of the
  DefaultServlet as relative to CATALINA_BASE/conf or CATALINA_HOME/conf.
  Prevent user supplied XSLTs used by the DefaultServlet from defining external
  entities.
