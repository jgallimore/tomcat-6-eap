                         Apache Tomcat 6.0 Patch Proposals
                         =================================


RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:

None


PATCHES PROPOSED TO BACKPORT:
  [ New proposals should be added at the end of the list ]

* Improvements to exe installer:
  Specify explicit JVM memory sizes when installing the service (--JvmMs,
  --JvmMx) with values of 128 Mb and 256 Mb respectively, the same as used
  by service.bat file.
  Explicitly specify --LogPath path when uninstalling Windows service. (The
  default value for that option was "%SystemRoot%\System32\LogFiles\Apache".)

* Enabling building with Java 8

         against the Tomcat 7 version of the class)

* Fix http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=56143
  and http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=49993

  Improve service.bat so that it can be launched from a non-UAC console,
  and backport other minor improvements.

  Update documentation. There is no more a need to start cmd.exe with
  elevated priviledges.

  Add support for '<version-major/>', '<version-major-minor>' to
  tomcat-docs.xsl to simplify documentation backports.

  (I am not backporting the "/user" option of service.bat. The rest of
  service.bat is the same as in TC7 and TC8.)

  Changes to service.bat:

  - Improve service.bat so that it can be launched from a non-UAC console.
  This includes using a single call to tomcat6.exe to install the Windows
  service rather than three calls, and using command line arguments instead
  of environment variables to pass the settings. (BZ 56143)

  - Align options with *.exe Windows installer. This affects --Classpath,
  --DisplayName, --StartPath, --StopPath and --LogPath.

  - Make command comparisons case-insensitive. Remove %OS% check for setlocal.

  (This assumes that nobody runs on ancient non-NT systems that do not have
  setlocal).

  - Improve check for JAVA_HOME and add support for JRE_HOME environment
  variable. (BZ 49993)

  - Print a warning in case if neither server nor client jvm is found.

  listener.
