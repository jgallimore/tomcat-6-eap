                         Apache Tomcat 6.0 Patch Proposals
                         =================================


RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:


PATCHES ACCEPTED TO BACKPORT:
  [ start all new proposals below, under PATCHES PROPOSED. ]

PATCHES PROPOSED TO BACKPORT:
  [ New proposals should be added at the end of the list ]

* Fix the maven stuff for the maven repo.
  Before it does't find tomcat-juli.jar and the remoteRepository seems broken .
  http://people.apache.org/~jfclere/patches/maven.patch.100711
  +1: jfclere
  -1: fhanik - easier to pass in the root path (lib/bin) to the macro instead of hacking around it
               if we remove the SCP auto feature, then there should be something to replace it with
               (http://ant.apache.org/manual/OptionalTasks/scp.html)
  +1: kkolinko: +1 for the updated patch (maven.patch.100711)
      I still think that it is not so good to remove the old code of <remoteRepository/>,
      because it ignores ${maven.repo.url} parameter provided by deploy-snapshot,
      deploy-staging and deploy-release targets. Maybe leave old code as a comment
      and fix it later if needed? I think that actually nobody besides the release manager
      uses this, so I am letting this pass.

* Add StuckThreadDetectionValve

  kkolinko: To view/download this as a patch file you add ".diff" to the URL above. That is:
  https://github.com/sylvainlaurent/tomcat60/commit/252334f958877221ecb2dc64ee0fd12bb77e360b.diff

  kkolinko: Minor glitches:
    - In mbeans-descriptors.xml:
      - There are no properties "asyncSupported", "stateName" in TC6 version of this valve.
    - In valve.xml:
      - s/tomcat log/Tomcat log/ (or Apache Tomcat log)
    - In StuckThreadDetectionValve.java:
      - private classes CompletedStuckThread, MonitoredThread: make them static (r1175897)
      - Use Long.valueOf() and explicit boxing/unboxing (r1138132, r1175897)
      - getStuckThreadIds() returns a list of ids. It might be useful to
        have a similar method that returns Thread.getName() names.

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=51940
  Don't limit saving of request bodies during FORM authentication to POST
  requests since any HTTP method may include a body.
  Based on a patch by Nicholas Sushkin

  +1: kkolinko: Performing a merge does not complete cleanly. Here is the
  actual patch:
   http://people.apache.org/~kkolinko/patches/2011-10-19_tc6_51940.patch

  Updated patch: added r1186378, r1186712
  r1186712 = restore original method name, so that it is printed correctly in access logs
  https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/attachment.cgi?id=27825

* Avoid an unnecessary session ID change notice. 
  Notice of changed session ID by JvmRouteBinderValve is unnecessary to BackupManager. 
  In BackupManager, change of session ID is replicated by the call of a setId() method.

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=52059
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=1186763&view=rev
  Fix a typo in Windows uninstaller:
  Do not forget to remove Tomcat keys from 32-bit registry on deinstallation.
  +1: kkolinko

* In GenericPrincipal, SerializablePrincipal:
  Do not sort lists that have only one element

PATCHES/ISSUES THAT ARE STALLED

* Backport JSP unloading patch (BZ48358).
  The patch has substantially changed since the original version.
  Original revisions are: 937787, 1028377, 1028389, 1028396, 1028861, 1028862, 1028863,
  1028935, 1028939, 1028940, 1028944, 1028950, 1030014, 1030037
  Combined TC 6 patch:
  http://people.apache.org/~rjung/patches/BZ48358-JSP_Unloading-TC6_20101118.patch
  +1: rjung
  -0: markt - http://markmail.org/thread/777be426ulcfmdd3 suggests there may be
              a memory leak in this code somewhere. I'd like to get to the
              bottom of that before porting this
      rjung:  I started a discussion about JSPs and memory on the dev list.
              The updated patch fixes a race condition.
              We can stall this item until we get some feedback about 7.0.5.
      markt - r1172614 needs to be included in this proposal. With that patch,
              my testing shows that the unloading works as designed
