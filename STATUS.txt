* Fix chunked encoding parsing
  The following patch fixes how the Comet processors blocks, it doesn't change the 
  way chunked parsing is done, but changing when it blocks and doesn't block.
  In the old way, it incorrectly blocks after parsing CRLF waiting for the next chunk
  In the new way, it wont block after CRLF
