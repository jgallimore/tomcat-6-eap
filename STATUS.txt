                         Apache Tomcat 6.0 Patch Proposals
                         =================================


RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:


PATCHES ACCEPTED TO BACKPORT:
  [ start all new proposals below, under PATCHES PROPOSED. ]

PATCHES PROPOSED TO BACKPORT:
  [ New proposals should be added at the end of the list ]

* Backport cleanup of semantics of thisAccessedTime and
  lastAccessedTime for sessions:
  - preparational whitespace changes
    http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=711695&view=rev
  - Give thisAccessedTime and lastAccessedTime for sessions
    a clear semantics:
    http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=711711&view=rev
    - thisAccessedTime will be updated at the beginning and
      at the end of session use
    - lastAccessedTime will only be updated at the end of
      session use
    This means:
    - lastAccessedTime is the last access time of a session
      disregarding any request still being processed on.
      So this is good to use even from within a request
      to detect when its own session has been used last before.
    - thisAccessedTime already gets updated when a new request
      disregarding any request still being processed on.
      So this is better for any idleness check or information.
    - thisAccessedTime >= lastAccessedTime always
  - Port from StandardSession to DeltaSession
    http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=711714&view=rev
  - Expose thisAccessedTime via the session interface
    and ManagerBase, so we can use it from outside the session.
    http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=711716&view=rev
  - Make the classes checking session idleness use thisAccessedTime.
    http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=711720&view=rev
    This is not for invalidation, only for displaying
    idle times and making persistance decisions.

   0: billbarker: generally agree with remm that this is too big of a change for the stable branch
                 but could agree to some of it if it was split into parts
   0: markt: Agree with Bill - smaller parts would be better
  -1: remm: no for TC 6.0
  -1: funkman : api change in Session.java for .x.x release


* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=47774
  Ensure web application class loader is used when calling session listeners

       Re approach:
         Request.isRequestedSessionIdValid() serves as implementation for
         HttpServletRequest.isRequestedSessionIdValid().
         I think that ClassLoader should already be set when calling this
         method.

         I mean, the problem is elsewhere. Supposedly in CoyoteAdapter.
         parseSessionCookiesId(), but may be earlier in the call chain.

         I won't oppose the patch. I have to think a bit more about it.

* Fix second part of https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=47413#c8
  Coerce result of composite EL expression (${a}${b}) from String to the expected type.
  The example demonstrating it was added in r892968.

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=48454
  Give the stderr reader a chance to finish before terminating the CGI process.
  This avoids "Bad file descriptor" errors. The period to wait is configurable.

    With s/3.0/2.5/, s/2.2/2.1/, and move declaration below the '-- Constants' comment.
    I have doubts regarding "java.runtime.version", as that property is not listed in
      http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/System.html#getProperties%28%29
    though
      - I see it mentioned in http://java.sun.com/j2se/versioning_naming.html
      - We already use it in o.a.c.util.ServerInfo and in the manager webapp
    An alternative patch using "java.vendor" and "java.version" is proposed below,
    though both are fine with me.

  Alternative patch:

* Allow special characters recognized by the Windows command-line shell to
  be present in the names of CATALINA_HOME/_BASE and the current directory
  used to call the Tomcat scripts.
  Fixes the problem reported for the '&' character:
    https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=48464#c4
  "help cmd" lists the following characters as special:
   <space> and &()[]{}^=;!'+,`~
  Note that:
   - cd, set, echo commands have to use quotes when a name contains '&'
   - names containing the space character are already working without this patch
  Patch:

  (a backport of revs. 895191, 895392)
