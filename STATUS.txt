                         Apache Tomcat 6.0 Patch Proposals
                         =================================


RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:


PATCHES ACCEPTED TO BACKPORT:
  [ start all new proposals below, under PATCHES PROPOSED. ]

PATCHES PROPOSED TO BACKPORT:
  [ New proposals should be added at the end of the list ]

* Backport cleanup of semantics of thisAccessedTime and
  lastAccessedTime for sessions:
  - preparational whitespace changes
    http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=711695&view=rev
  - Give thisAccessedTime and lastAccessedTime for sessions
    a clear semantics:
    http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=711711&view=rev
    - thisAccessedTime will be updated at the beginning and
      at the end of session use
    - lastAccessedTime will only be updated at the end of
      session use
    This means:
    - lastAccessedTime is the last access time of a session
      disregarding any request still being processed on.
      So this is good to use even from within a request
      to detect when its own session has been used last before.
    - thisAccessedTime already gets updated when a new request 
      disregarding any request still being processed on.
      So this is better for any idleness check or information.
    - thisAccessedTime >= lastAccessedTime always
  - Port from StandardSession to DeltaSession
    http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=711714&view=rev
  - Expose thisAccessedTime via the session interface
    and ManagerBase, so we can use it from outside the session.
    http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=711716&view=rev
  - Make the classes checking session idleness use thisAccessedTime.
    http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=711720&view=rev
    This is not for invalidation, only for displaying
    idle times and making persistance decisions.

  JAAS LoginContext expects a call to logout()

* Improve NIO connector shutdown time by doing shutdowns in parallel
  and with a timeout
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=791914
  +1: fhanik, markt, kkolinko, jim
  -1: 
  kkolinko: (
    Some nit-picking:
    1. I think that it is better to create the stopLatch in the NioEndpoint#start()
    method right before the array of Pollers is created, instead of NioEndpoint#init().
    And to pass a reference to it to the Poller (as an argument in Poller
    constructor).
    That is because otherwise if you call stop() start() the stopLatch won't be in
    its initial condition, and because the count of pollers can be changed between
    init() and start(). Just a theory, though.
    
    2. In NioEndpoint.Poller#run():
    - if the Poller was looping with paused=true, is there a need to call
    events() before exiting the loop on if (close) ?
    - there are several ways to exit the loop: two if(close), one while
     (running), and may be exceptions. The first if(close) does not call
     selector.close(). And if you exit because of running = false there is
     no call to timeout(0, false); and selector.close().
    - there is special processing code for OutOfMemoryError, but inside the
     loop, and in events() method, you catch any Throwable.
    - it would be better to put stopLatch.countDown() inside a finally{} block
    3. In NioEndpoint.Poller#destroy() there is comment ("// Wait...").
    Is it still relevant? I do not see any waiting there.
  )

* Port TLD processing improvements from trunk
  There have been quite a few changes to TLD processing and they are tightly
  coupled. Therefore, this proposal is a series of patches and the patches
  need to be applied in order. Even then the patches do not apply completely
  cleanly so a rolled up patch has been provided at each stage.
  Note: The JSP TCK passes with the full set of patches applied.
  The benefit is twofold. First a number of edge case bugs I came across are
  fixed. The short version is that the Catalina code and the Jasper code did
  things differently. As well as the inherent inconsistencies (and hence bugs)
  this created it also made it much harder to add the additional functionality
  I was trying to add for embeddability. Which brings me to the second benefit.
  With these fixes in place, the changes I was trying to make (patch to follow
  when I have done more testing) for embeddability become possible.
  Step 1: Clean-up

  Step 2: Make validation configuration per-context

  +1: markt
  -1: 
  Step 4: Sync Catalina and Jasper code so a) they have the same behaviour and
  b) use the same code so they are easier to keep in sync.

  +1: markt
  -1: 

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=47699
  Better handling of PID files
  https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/attachment.cgi?id=24202
  +1: markt
  +1: fhanik (although, on .sh, I think we could get rid of 'Bootstrap stop' by now, shutdown hooks have been available for quite some time)
  -1: 
   
  

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=44041
  Threading issue in classloading. Adds a sync so please check performance
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=805182&view=rev 
  +1: markt
   0: jim
  -1: fhanik, I would say a thread safe, yet concurrent implementation would do
      synchronized (className.intern()) {
        //perform class loading
      }
      instead of synchronizing the entire method and hence only allowing class loading one class at a time
      

* Allow per instance log4j.properties, JAR files (JDBC drivers) etc
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=810916&view=rev
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=810977&view=rev
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=821397&view=rev
  +1: markt, kkolinko, fhanik
  -1:
  kkolinko: re RUNNING.txt update: it'd be better to replace "eg" with "e.g."

* Allow per instance configuration of JULI or log4j for core Tomcat logging
  This requires the classpath change above
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=810976&view=rev
  +1: markt, rjung, fhanik
  -1: kkolinko: we should not remove tomcat-juli.jar from bootstrap.jar.manifest
  kkolinko: Regarding /res/bootstrap.jar.manifest change:
    It will cause problems e.g. in Eclipse IDE.
    If I configure a Tomcat server instance there, it is created with a
    classpath that consists only of bootstrap.jar and JDK's tools.jar. That
    has to be changed to include tomcat-juli.jar as well.
    While that is configurable, it is not so obvious (you have to click
    some underlined text on some wordy page) and there can be a lot of
    confusion when the product ceases functioning out-of-the box.

    I also like that I can run Tomcat easily by typing "java -jar bootstrap.jar start"
    That option will also be lost.

    I think that we can implement the same feature by adding
    ${CATALINA_BASE}/bin/tomcat-juli.jar to the classpath before
    bootstrap.jar   We can propose people to manually remove
    tomcat-juli.jar from ${CATALINA_HOME}/bin if they want, though I doubt
    that that will be necessary.

* Make FileHandler.java extensible
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/tomcat/trunk/java/org/apache/juli/FileHandler.java?r1=666232&r2=709018&pathrev=793882&view=patch
  +1: fhanik, jim, markt, kkolinko

* Allow configurable buffer size of loggers
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=814708&view=rev
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=814876&view=rev
  +1: fhanik, jim, markt, kkolinko
  -1:

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=46950
  Adds support for SSL renegotiation when CLIENT-CERT auth is required due to a
  security constraint
  Note: Patch cannot be applied until tc-native 1.1.17 has been released
        since it depends on a new native method
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=815418&view=rev
  +1: markt, jfclere, fhanik
   0: jim
  -1: 

* Align native and Java method names.
  Port/backport from trunk, TC5.5.x, tc4.1.x and tcnative (trunk and 1.1.x)
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=815748&view=rev
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=815768&view=rev
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=706574&view=rev
  Plus the last hunk for Socket.java in
  https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/attachment.cgi?id=24276
  +1: rjung, markt, fhanik
  -1: 
  +1: kkolinko:(
    Should be applied when tc-native 1.1.17 is released,
    because of native method names and argument types changes.

    We will need to update minimum required version
    (in o.a.c.core.AprLifecycleListener, o.a.c.connector.Connector).

    Also, attachment.cgi?id=24276 looks like a wrong patch to vote.
    It is a documentation patch. There is no need to vote for it. And it is
    not for Socket.java.
  )
  rjung: Note that java/org/apache/tomcat/jni/Buffer.java
  is missing in TC 6. Don't know, whether we should add it.
  It is in 5.5, trunk and tcnative 1.1.
  markt: Happy either way with slight preference for adding it
  kkolinko: Either way is OK, but, as I cannot find any usages of Buffer
  methods neither in TC 5.5 nor in trunk, I would prefer to remove this
  class at least from trunk, but better from both, and even from native
  side.
  
* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=47267
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=817822&view=rev
  +1: markt
  -1:
  rjung: Our dreaded multi platform build system is a bit fragile
  w.r.t. fixcrlf. If you change the file to crlf in the installer
  target, then all unix packages (which are build after installer)
  will also contain it in crlf format. Not to bad for especially
  that file (because part of a webapp), but maybe it would
  be cleaner to do this for the installer target only, e.g.
  saving the file, fixcrlf, run nsi, restoring file.

  kkolinko: Another way to fix it would be to place a copy of that file
  into %CATALINA_HOME% (with proper CRLF endings) and display that one in
  the installer, leaving the one in the ROOT webapp as is. Note, that we
  already have these two copies of the file in our zip/tgz distributions.

* Fix memory leak causes by a JRE implementation change in 1.6.0_15 onwards

  Be more careful about skipping over sections we aren't interested in
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=828201

  Protect against a context file briefly disappearing due to text editor
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=828210
  +1: markt, kkolinko, rjung
  -1: 

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=47987
  Limit size of not found resources cache
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=828759&view=rev
  +1: markt, kkolinko, rjung
  -1: 

* Refix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=37848
  Don't output info messages when there is no terminal
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=828225&view=rev
  +1: markt, kkolinko, rjung
  -1: 
  rjung: the scripts tend to get more and more complex.
  So maybe it's time e.g. to use a shell function
  doing the tty check instead of repeated "if ... echo ..."

* Use correct flag for SSL
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=831106&view=rev
  +1: fhanik, kkolinko, rjung
  -1:

* Fix ReplicationValve CrossContext support
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=831718&view=rev
  +1: pero, rjung
  -1:

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=47451
  Don't throw NPEs if the various response.setHeader() methods are called with
  null header name, zero length header name or null value. Silently ignore the
  calls the same way we do if the response has already been committed
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=831774&view=rev
  +1: markt, kkolinko, rjung
  -1: 
  rjung: Calling a common check method with params name, value, and
         isNullValueAllowed or something like that seems nicer than
         copying all the checks around.

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=47331
  Treat uninterpretted tags as template text for JSP.2.2
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=831785&view=rev
  +1: markt, rjung
  -1: 

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=48097
  There are two patches to be applied:
  1) Make WebappClassLoader to do not swallow AccessControlException
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=831828&view=rev
  +1: kkolinko, rjung
  -1:

  2) Patch for SecurityClassLoad to preload o.a.c.loader.ResourceEntry class
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=831830&view=rev
  +1: kkolinko
  -1:

* Include root cause exception into the one produced by ApplicationContextFacade#doPrivileged()
  It is backport of rev.831819
  The difference from rev.831819 is that second "doPrivileged" that is
  private and unused one, and is already absent in trunk, is being removed.
  http://people.apache.org/~kkolinko/patches/2009-11-02_ApplicationContextFacade.patch
  +1: kkolinko, rjung

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=47881
  Fix processing of "startd" and "stopd" arguments, when they are not alone.
