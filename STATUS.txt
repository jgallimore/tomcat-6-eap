PATCHES PROPOSED TO BACKPORT:
  [ New proposals should be added at the end of the list ]


* Add ManagerBase session getLastAccessedTimestamp and getCreationTimestamp for better
  remote JMX access.
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=612971&view=rev
  +1: pero, rjung, fhanik, markt
  -1: remm: I believe it would need specific support for certain managers. Interested users
            could use their own extended manager instead.

* Fix http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=44282
  Do call to getClassLoader() in a privileged block.
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=616953&view=rev
  +1: markt, fhanik, yoavs
  +0: remm: do we really want to fix these sort of "bugs" ?

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=45015
  You can't use an unescaped quote if you quote the value with that character
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=657231&view=rev
  +1: markt
  -1: remm (I think it is a good patch, but it throws an error for something which was working before,
            so I would think keeping it for the next release would be better)

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=44994
  Correct BNF grammar so ${0 lt a ? 1 lt a ? "many": "one": "none"} works
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=657404&view=rev
  Note patch is larger than strictly necessary due to autogenerated code
  +1: markt, yoavs
  -1: 

* Additional patch from https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=43094
  Allow configuration of JSSE providers
