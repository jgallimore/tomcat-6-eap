                         Apache Tomcat 6.0 Patch Proposals
                         =================================


RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:

None


PATCHES PROPOSED TO BACKPORT:
  [ New proposals should be added at the end of the list ]

* Assert that MappingData object is empty before performing mapping work.
  It is backport of r1604663

  Motivation: Remove dead branches. Protect Mapper from operating on
  non-recycled MappingData. Using non-recycled MappingData might result in
  mapping request onto a different target, like an issue that prevented us
  from releasing 8.0.4 and fixed by r1580080/r1580083. I do not know such
  bugs in Tomcat 6, but I want the code to be more safe.
  Just a single (mappingData.host != null) check is enough to discern
  recycled vs. non-recycled data. Checks for other MappingData fields are
  removed by this patch, simplifying the code.

  A patch generated with "svn diff -x --ignore-space-change" for easier
  overview of the change is

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=56780
  Enable Tomcat to start when using a IBM JRE in strict SP800-131a mode
  This back-ports the fix as well as some additional changes to more closely
  align the Tomcat 6 code with the code in Tomcat 7.

PATCHES/ISSUES THAT ARE STALLED:

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=44312
  Log an error if there is a conflict between Host and Alias names.
  Improve host management methods in Mapper to avoid occasionally removing
  a wrong host. Check that host management operations are performed on
  the host and not on an alias.

   kkolinko: Good for occasional review, but as backporting r1608833 won't
   be trivial I'd have to update the patch.
