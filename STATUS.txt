                         Apache Tomcat 6.0 Patch Proposals
                         =================================


RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:

None


PATCHES PROPOSED TO BACKPORT:
  [ New proposals should be added at the end of the list ]

* Assert that MappingData object is empty before performing mapping work.
  It is backport of r1604663

  Motivation: Remove dead branches. Protect Mapper from operating on
  non-recycled MappingData. Using non-recycled MappingData might result in
  mapping request onto a different target, like an issue that prevented us
  from releasing 8.0.4 and fixed by r1580080/r1580083. I do not know such
  bugs in Tomcat 6, but I want the code to be more safe.
  Just a single (mappingData.host != null) check is enough to discern
  recycled vs. non-recycled data. Checks for other MappingData fields are
  removed by this patch, simplifying the code.

  A patch generated with "svn diff -x --ignore-space-change" for easier
  overview of the change is

   kkolinko:
     Good.
     I think this makes BZ 57116 fixed as well.
     Several notes:
      1) From BZ 56780 the static{} block in JSSESocketFactory
       needs try/catch(IllegalArgumentException),
       like it is already done in Tomcat 7 in r1615951

      2) In getEnabledProtocols() the
        "if (requestedProtocols == null) { return DEFAULT_SERVER_PROTOCOLS; }"
       block can be moved several lines earlier.

      3) From BZ 56780 the DEFAULT_SERVER_PROTOCOLS value might result as
      null. I am afraid that passing that null to Java APIs will result in
      some cryptic messages. This question may be addressed later via BZ 56780.
        https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=56780#c9

      schultz: it's not clear from the code what will happen if
               DEFAULT_SERVER_PROTOCOLS remains null. Would it be more clear
               to use an empty string array instead of null? I seem to recall
               slightly different "null" behavior in Oracle/OpenJDK versus
               IBM JVMs.

* Fix timestamps in Tomcat build to use 24-hour format instead of 12-hour
  one and use UTC timezone.

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=53952
  Add support for TLSv1.1 and TLSv1.2 to APR connector.
  Back-port r1632606 from Tomcat 7.

* Update to Tomcat Native 1.1.32
  I do not change versions in AprLifecycleListener. Changing
  "recommended" version (TCN_RECOMMENDED_PV) is covered by schultz's BZ
  53952 patch above and I think that there is no pressing need to change
  the "required" version.

* Configure javadoc tool to read sources as ISO-8859-1, suppress timestamp
  comments and enable charset header.

  Motivation:
  Timestamp comments: It makes diff between javadoc versions smaller. The
  diff between versions will still change almost every file, because of
  Tomcat version (6.0.41) in title of the pages, but the change will be a
  bit smaller.

  Charset header: The rest of Tomcat 6 documentation already has <META>
  header with charset information in generated HTML. This enables it for
  Javadoc as well.

PATCHES/ISSUES THAT ARE STALLED:

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=44312
  Log an error if there is a conflict between Host and Alias names.
  Improve host management methods in Mapper to avoid occasionally removing
  a wrong host. Check that host management operations are performed on
  the host and not on an alias.

   kkolinko: Good for occasional review, but as backporting r1608833 won't
   be trivial I'd have to update the patch.
