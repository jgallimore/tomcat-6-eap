                         Apache Tomcat 6.0 Patch Proposals
                         =================================


RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:

None


PATCHES PROPOSED TO BACKPORT:
  [ New proposals should be added at the end of the list ]

* BIO tolerates whitespace in the ciphers attribute whereas NIO does not. Make
  NIO tolerate it as well
  http://people.apache.org/~markt/patches/2014-01-18-ciphers-whitespace-nio-tc6-v1.patch
  +1: markt, rjung, schultz
  +1: kkolinko: OK, though I have two comments:
       1. If we align NIO and BIO here, the code in JSSESocketFactory.getEnabledCiphers(..)
       also skips empty tokens.
       2. There is similar code in TC7 & trunk in AbstractEndpoint.setCiphers(),
       but it has not been fixed yet.
       Actually as far as I see the ciphersarr is never used in TC7 &
       trunk, as there are no calls to AbstractEndpoint.getCiphersArray().
  -1:

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=56029
  Regression in fix for BZ55198 broke parsing of some ternary expressions
  Align tc6 implementation with that of trunk (diff to trunk is easy to review)
