                         Apache Tomcat 6.0 Patch Proposals
                         =================================


RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:


PATCHES ACCEPTED TO BACKPORT:
  [ start all new proposals below, under PATCHES PROPOSED. ]

PATCHES PROPOSED TO BACKPORT:
  [ New proposals should be added at the end of the list ]

* Backport UserDataHelper class (issue 52184)
  Provide greater control over the logging of errors triggered by invalid
  input data (i.e. data over which Tomcat has no control).

  Note: cookies logging (o.a.t.util.http.Cookies) does not need to be
  addressed in Tomcat 6, because all logging in that class here is done at
  debug level.

* For https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=52055
  Ensure that filters are recycled.
  Inspired by r1334790 (TC7), r565964 (TC6 Nio)
  I do not have evidence that this change matters, but it should not hurt.
  The nextRequest() method already recycles the filters. If it has been called,
  then lastActiveFilter is -1 and the new code will be NOOP.

* Improve method cache handling in SecurityUtil class.
  Add caching for Comet methods and simplify cache lookup code.
  It is backport of r728776 (BZ 46304) and r1429360

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=54601
  Change catalina.sh to consistently use LOGGING_MANAGER variable to
  configure logging, instead of modifying JAVA_OPTS one.
  https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/attachment.cgi?id=29985
  (backport of r1449406; r1449412 in tc7)

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=54615
  Update to Eclipse JDT Compiler 4.2.2
  http://people.apache.org/~kkolinko/patches/2013-03-26_tc6_eclipse422.patch
  +1: kkolinko, rjung
  -1: jfclere: I am ~OK to add the method to allow to compile but not to
      change the major version of ecj

PATCHES/ISSUES THAT ARE STALLED

* Backport JSP unloading patch (BZ48358).
  The patch has substantially changed since the original version.
  Original revisions are: 937787, 1028377, 1028389, 1028396, 1028861, 1028862, 1028863,
  1028935, 1028939, 1028940, 1028944, 1028950, 1030014, 1030037
  Combined TC 6 patch:
  http://people.apache.org/~rjung/patches/BZ48358-JSP_Unloading-TC6_20101118.patch
  +1: rjung
  -0: markt - http://markmail.org/thread/777be426ulcfmdd3 suggests there may be
              a memory leak in this code somewhere. I'd like to get to the
              bottom of that before porting this
      rjung:  I started a discussion about JSPs and memory on the dev list.
              The updated patch fixes a race condition.
              We can stall this item until we get some feedback about 7.0.5.
      markt - r1172614 needs to be included in this proposal. With that patch,
              my testing shows that the unloading works as designed
      kkolinko - r1428358 (r1428355) is needed - a fix for BZ 54260.
