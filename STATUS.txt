                         Apache Tomcat 6.0 Patch Proposals
                         =================================


RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:


PATCHES ACCEPTED TO BACKPORT:
  [ start all new proposals below, under PATCHES PROPOSED. ]

PATCHES PROPOSED TO BACKPORT:
  [ New proposals should be added at the end of the list ]

* Backport UserDataHelper class (issue 52184)
  Provide greater control over the logging of errors triggered by invalid
  input data (i.e. data over which Tomcat has no control).

  Note: cookies logging (o.a.t.util.http.Cookies) does not need to be
  addressed in Tomcat 6, because all logging in that class here is done at
  debug level.

  http://people.apache.org/~kkolinko/patches/2012-03-26_tc6_UserDataHelper.patch
  (includes a new file, copied from trunk:
  svn cp ../../trunk/java/org/apache/tomcat/util/log/UserDataHelper.java@1242371 java/org/apache/tomcat/util/log/UserDataHelper.java
  )

* For https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=52055
  Ensure that filters are recycled.
  Inspired by r1334790 (TC7), r565964 (TC6 Nio)
  I do not have evidence that this change matters, but it should not hurt.
  The nextRequest() method already recycles the filters. If it has been called,
  then lastActiveFilter is -1 and the new code will be NOOP.

PATCHES/ISSUES THAT ARE STALLED

* Backport JSP unloading patch (BZ48358).
  The patch has substantially changed since the original version.
  Original revisions are: 937787, 1028377, 1028389, 1028396, 1028861, 1028862, 1028863,
  1028935, 1028939, 1028940, 1028944, 1028950, 1030014, 1030037
  Combined TC 6 patch:
  http://people.apache.org/~rjung/patches/BZ48358-JSP_Unloading-TC6_20101118.patch
  +1: rjung
  -0: markt - http://markmail.org/thread/777be426ulcfmdd3 suggests there may be
              a memory leak in this code somewhere. I'd like to get to the
              bottom of that before porting this
      rjung:  I started a discussion about JSPs and memory on the dev list.
              The updated patch fixes a race condition.
              We can stall this item until we get some feedback about 7.0.5.
      markt - r1172614 needs to be included in this proposal. With that patch,
              my testing shows that the unloading works as designed

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=52918
  Add WebSocket support to Tomcat 6
  +1: fhanik
  -0: jfclere
  -0: kkolinko:
       - Interesting, but I do not think there is much interest in it.
         If one needs this feature I would suggest to upgrade to Tomcat 7.
         If one cannot upgrade to Tomcat 7 then they probably cannot
         upgrade to a later Tomcat 6 either.
       - The protocol specification still evolves. I think it is too risky
         to implement websockets for Tomcat 6.
       - Formally, the proposal does not have a link to the patch.
       - The patch in Bugzilla does not include latest changes from Tomcat 7. E.g.
            http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1380841
         (Is one supposed to just copy the current version of websocket
         package from Tomcat 7 here?)
