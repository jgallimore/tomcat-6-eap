                         Apache Tomcat 6.0 Patch Proposals
                         =================================


PATCHES PROPOSED TO BACKPORT:
  [ New proposals should be added at the end of the list ]


* Add ManagerBase session getLastAccessedTimestamp and getCreationTimestamp for better
  remote JMX access.
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=612971&view=rev
  +1: pero, rjung, fhanik, markt
  -1: remm: I believe it would need specific support for certain managers. Interested users
            could use their own extended manager instead.

* Remove old TLS code
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=616894&view=rev
  +1: markt, fhanik
  +0: remm: I don't see the point of backporting these API changing cleanups
            (markt) This is not an API change. It is just removing the TLS code
                    that has never been included in a 6.0.x src or bin release
           It's my fault for not building it in then. I'm not sure this is intentional,
           but I am ok with the change.

* Modify NIo connector to use JSSE SSL implementation directly
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=616896&view=rev
  +1: markt, fhanik
  +1: remm: ok
            (markt) This is not an API change. It is preparation for an API
                    change which will now be in a future release. The method
                    that needs to be removed will now be marked as deprecated
                    in 6.0.x (see patch below).

* Mark method that adds a JSSE dependency to the SSL abstraction as deprecated
  http://people.apache.org/~markt/patches/2008-02-21-SSL-JSSE.patch
  +1: markt, fhanik
  -1:

* Fix http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=44282
  Do call to getClassLoader() in a privileged block.
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=616953&view=rev
  +1: markt, fhanik
  +0: remm: do we really want to fix these sort of "bugs" ?
  -1:

* ExtendedAccessLogValve cs-uri not print empty querystring
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=620778&view=rev
  +1: pero,funkman,markt

* lib is relative to catalina home, not base
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=627602&view=rev
  +1: markt, fhanik
  -1: 

* Fix NPE when iterating through sessions for expiration
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=627689
  +1: fhanik, markt, remm, jfclere
  -1:
  
* Allow old style cookie values to work(auto switch to v1) (regression)
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=627743 (ServerCookie.java)
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=630533 (use the same variable name for all servlet compliance flags)
  +1: fhanik, markt
  -1: 
  
* Fix ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException when empty URL is requested
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=627883&view=rev
  +1: markt
  +1: fhanik - although, I just don't see how this would ever happen, the smallest URI is "/"
  -1:

* Allow to specify the random device to use. (/dev/urandom is faster).
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=602114
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=601795
  +1: jfclere, fhanik
  +0: markt - should really be added to the docs as well
  -1:

* Add tests for the cookie parsing and use package org.apache.catalina.tomcat.util.http
  http://people.apache.org/~jfclere/patches/test_cookies.patch2
  +1: jfclere, fhanik, markt
  -1:

* Point to Wiki for latest status and remove very out of date status page from
  docs
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=630006&view=rev
  +1: markt, fhanik
  -1:

* Update docs. Correct version number, paths and use of $CATALINA_HOME vs.
  $CATALINA_BASE
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=630013&view=rev
  +1: markt, fhanik, jfclere
