                         Apache Tomcat 6.0 Patch Proposals
                         =================================


RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:


PATCHES ACCEPTED TO BACKPORT:
  [ start all new proposals below, under PATCHES PROPOSED. ]


PATCHES PROPOSED TO BACKPORT:
  [ New proposals should be added at the end of the list ]

* Backport cleanup of semantics of thisAccessedTime and
  lastAccessedTime for sessions:
  - preparational whitespace changes
    http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=711695&view=rev
  - Give thisAccessedTime and lastAccessedTime for sessions
    a clear semantics:
    http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=711711&view=rev
    - thisAccessedTime will be updated at the beginning and
      at the end of session use
    - lastAccessedTime will only be updated at the end of
      session use
    This means:
    - lastAccessedTime is the last access time of a session
      disregarding any request still being processed on.
      So this is good to use even from within a request
      to detect when its own session has been used last before.
    - thisAccessedTime already gets updated when a new request
      disregarding any request still being processed on.
      So this is better for any idleness check or information.
    - thisAccessedTime >= lastAccessedTime always
  - Port from StandardSession to DeltaSession
    http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=711714&view=rev
  - Expose thisAccessedTime via the session interface
    and ManagerBase, so we can use it from outside the session.
    http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=711716&view=rev
  - Make the classes checking session idleness use thisAccessedTime.
    http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=711720&view=rev
    This is not for invalidation, only for displaying
    idle times and making persistance decisions.
  +1: rjung
   0: billbarker: generally agree with remm that this is too big of a change for the stable branch
                 but could agree to some of it if it was split into parts
   0: markt: Agree with Bill - smaller parts would be better
  -1: remm: no for TC 6.0
  -1: funkman : api change in Session.java for .x.x release

* Allow special characters recognized by the Windows command-line shell to
  be present in the names of CATALINA_HOME/_BASE and the current directory
  used to call the Tomcat scripts.
  Fixes the problem reported for the '&' character:
    https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=48464#c4
  "help cmd" lists the following characters as special:
   <space> and &()[]{}^=;!'+,`~
  Note that:
   - cd, set, echo commands have to use quotes when a name contains '&'
   - names containing the space character are already working without this patch
  Patch:
  http://people.apache.org/~kkolinko/patches/2010-01-03_bug48464-c4_ampersand_tc6.patch
  (a backport of revs. 895191, 895392)
  Tested on Windows XP.
  +1: kkolinko, rjung, markt
  -1:
  rjung: I would slightly prefer to apply after we finally managed to produce a working
         release for 6.0.x, since changes in the Windows bat files are hard to test
         for all possible cases, paths etc.
         The 'set "a=%b%"' trick is nice, because if you only use the quotation
         marks around the rhs, Windows actually adds them to the value of 'a'.

* Force disconnect upon transmission failure
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=898906&view=rev
  +1: fhanik, jim, pero

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=48614
  Stream encoder uses an internal buffer and the wrong default was being used in the code
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=903916&view=rev
  +1: fhanik, markt
  +1: kkolinko: only if documentation on bufferSize property in logging.xml
    is updated as well
    ( Re documentation: maybe it would be easier to make a table of
    configurable properties for JULI and JDK JUL classes somewhere on the
    logging.xml page, or in the JavaDoc of the FileHandler class. - see issue 39661.
    I see that I haven't documented the "encoding" property of JULI
    FileHandler yet. )

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=48613
  Only attempt APR initialization if the <Listener> has been specified

* Fix the maven stuff for the maven repo.
  Before it does't find tomcat-juli.jar and the remoteRepository seems broken .
  http://people.apache.org/~jfclere/patches/maven.patch
  +1: jfclere
  -1: fhanik - easier to pass in the root path (lib/bin) to the macro instead of hacking around it
               if we remove the SCP auto feature, then there should be something to replace it with
               (http://ant.apache.org/manual/OptionalTasks/scp.html)  

* Add some debug logging where exceptions where previously swallowed

  Get nested role search working when {1} is used in roleSearch
  Patch provided by Gabriel
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=904914&view=rev
  +1: markt
  -1:
  -0: kkolinko: I think using groupDN for {1} does not match the
    documentation, and I am not sure that it will work even for the OP of that issue,
    though I would like to know more about his configuration to be sure.
    See my comment #2 for that issue.

  +1: markt
  +1: kkolinko:
     899653: OK.  We do not have @Deprecated annotations in those classes,
                  so the patch is about adding @SuppressWarnings("dep-ann")
     899769: With 899770 that backports the message string used here. 
     899770: OK
         (Maybe better name for that message, because it says about arrays,
         yet name is rather generic).
     899783: OK
     899788: OK
         (Likewise, o.a.jasper.el.ELResolverImpl#getType(ELContext,Object,Object)
         should probably throw a PropertyNotFoundException, instead of returning null.
         I have no proof, though.)
     899792: OK
     899916: OK

     899918, 899919: OK, but there is probably an omission in the EL spec:
         I do not see why we do conversion Enum->Enum via toString() call.

         The EL spec chapter 1.18.6 'Coerce A to an Enum Type T' says
            "If A is a String call Enum.valueOf(T.getClass(), A) and return the result."
         It does not say what to do if A is not a String. (There is no
         explicit "Otherwise, error" statement below).

         In 1.18.7 (aka ELSupport#coerceToType(Object, Class)) we throw
         an error if A is not a String. Even if T has a PropertyEditor,
         we do not do  editor.setAsText(obj.toString()),  as the spec does
         not say to do so, but throw an exception.

         (In 1.18.7 the spec says "Otherwise, apply T's PropertyEditor",
         but PropertyEditor can be applied only is A is a String. Am I right?)

         Without 899919 patch we will throw a ClassCaseException when object type
         is a different type of enum, but other values are still converted
         via toString() call.  The patch makes that behaviour consistent, even
         if I do not understand why it is allowed.

     899935: OK
     899949: OK,
         but why ValueExpressionImpl.equals() is implemented as comparing
         the hash codes? What will happen with false positives?

  This is a regression caused by the fix for
  https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=42390
  The requirement for variable declaration also depends on whether or not a
  fragment helper has been used for the parent tag (if any). Where such a helper
  has been used, the variables must be redefined.
  Test cases for both bugs and the JSP TCK pass with this patch applied.
