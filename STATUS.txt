                         Apache Tomcat 6.0 Patch Proposals
                         =================================


RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:

None


PATCHES PROPOSED TO BACKPORT:
  [ New proposals should be added at the end of the list ]

* Assert that MappingData object is empty before performing mapping work.
  It is backport of r1604663

  Motivation: Remove dead branches. Protect Mapper from operating on
  non-recycled MappingData. Using non-recycled MappingData might result in
  mapping request onto a different target, like an issue that prevented us
  from releasing 8.0.4 and fixed by r1580080/r1580083. I do not know such
  bugs in Tomcat 6, but I want the code to be more safe.
  Just a single (mappingData.host != null) check is enough to discern
  recycled vs. non-recycled data. Checks for other MappingData fields are
  removed by this patch, simplifying the code.

  A patch generated with "svn diff -x --ignore-space-change" for easier
  overview of the change is

* Fix generics warnings in Mapper.

  Motivation: Resolve IDE warnings to make it easier to spot more serious
  errors when working on this class.
  It is just some local variables. No change in functionality or APIs.

* Mitigate POODLE by disabling SSLv3 by default for JSSE

  -0: kkolinko: I think that JSSESocketFactory.getEnabledProtocols() shall
       not return DEFAULT_SERVER_PROTOCOLS list in case if there are no
       matches. This behaviour silently enables default list of protocols,
       instead of erroring out.
       This bug did exist before this patch, so I filed
        https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=57116

       I wish there were some debug logging to see what protocols are being
       filtered out by "if (protocol.contains("SSL"))".

* Fix timestamps in Tomcat build to use 24-hour format instead of 12-hour
  one and use UTC timezone.

PATCHES/ISSUES THAT ARE STALLED:

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=44312
  Log an error if there is a conflict between Host and Alias names.
  Improve host management methods in Mapper to avoid occasionally removing
  a wrong host. Check that host management operations are performed on
  the host and not on an alias.

  4) TestMapper changes from http://svn.apache.org/r1608831

   kkolinko: Good for occasional review, but as backporting r1608833 won't
   be trivial I'd have to update the patch.
