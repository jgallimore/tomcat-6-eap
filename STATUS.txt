PATCHES PROPOSED TO BACKPORT:
  [ New proposals should be added at the end of the list ]

* Redefine the <code>globalXsltFile</code> initialisation parameter of the
  DefaultServlet as relative to CATALINA_BASE/conf or CATALINA_HOME/conf.
  Prevent user supplied XSLTs used by the DefaultServlet from defining external
  entities.

  +1: markt, kkolinko, remm
  -1: schultz: The idea of the patch is fine: I'm actually +1.
               I have some small nits:
               2. Two instances of swallowing IOException
               when closing File streams. We should at least log a warning.
               The case of InputStream vs OutputStream is not relevant:
               a stream left open should be logged. Honestly, it will
               pretty much never happen, but that's no excuse not to log
               a potential problem.
      kkolinko:
        Re 2.:
          Those are input streams that are read, not written. Nothing
          should really happen when those are closed.
      remm: no need to add i18n for something that will not happen

* Fix http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=56283
  Add Java 8 support to Jasper's default configuration
  http://people.apache.org/~markt/patches/2014-03-19-Jasper-Java8-tc6-v1.patch
  +1: markt, remm
  +0: kkolinko:
       - See r1557990. There are noTldJars lists in TldConfig, TldLocationsCache
         that have to be updated. Maybe add support for "ecj-*.jar" pattern
         there? (If not, then just add "4.3.2" and "P20140317-1600" versions).

       - Technically CompilerOptions.VERSION_1_8 is a String constant "1.8",
         so it will be inlined at compile time. At runtime Jasper will be
         compatible with any earlier versions of ecj 4.3.x.
         Thus I am OK with this change.
