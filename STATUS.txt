* Assert that MappingData object is empty before performing mapping work.
  It is backport of r1604663

  Motivation: Remove dead branches. Protect Mapper from operating on
  non-recycled MappingData. Using non-recycled MappingData might result in
  mapping request onto a different target, like an issue that prevented us
  from releasing 8.0.4 and fixed by r1580080/r1580083. I do not know such
  bugs in Tomcat 6, but I want the code to be more safe.
  Just a single (mappingData.host != null) check is enough to discern
  recycled vs. non-recycled data. Checks for other MappingData fields are
  removed by this patch, simplifying the code.

  A patch generated with "svn diff -x --ignore-space-change" for easier
  overview of the change is

* Fix generics warnings in Mapper.

  Motivation: Resolve IDE warnings to make it easier to spot more serious
  errors when working on this class.
  It is just some local variables. No change in functionality or APIs.

  Based on a patch by Neeme Praks.

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=43001
  Enable the JspC Ant task to set the JspC option mappedFile.

  Motivation: A really simple fix. The mappedFile option has different
  default (false) in JspC vs. EmbeddedServletOptions, and there was no way
  to configure it in an Ant task.

PATCHES/ISSUES THAT ARE STALLED:

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=44312
  Log an error if there is a conflict between Host and Alias names.
  Improve host management methods in Mapper to avoid occasionally removing
  a wrong host. Check that host management operations are performed on
  the host and not on an alias.

  4) TestMapper changes from http://svn.apache.org/r1608831

   kkolinko: Good for occasional review, but as backporting r1608833 won't
   be trivial I'd have to update the patch.
