PATCHES PROPOSED TO BACKPORT:
  [ New proposals should be added at the end of the list ]

* Back-port patch to allow different kinds of FIPS configuration.
  http://people.apache.org/~schultz/patches/tcnative.heartbleed.tomcat6.diff
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=r1587379
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&amp;revision=r1587723 (adapt)
  (Note: requires tcnative 1.1.30)

       a) I cannot test (without FIPS-enabled library), but from my code review
          the new options will not work because you are not setting
          "fipsModeActive" field in AprLifecycleListener.

          Thus AprLifecycleListener.isFIPSModeActive() will return false
          and startup will be aborted.

       b) It needs backport of r1588102 as an Exception is thrown by native code

       c) "enterFipsMode = 1 != fipsModeState;" code and comment before it are wrong.

          FIPS_mode() function of OpenSSL is documented to return non-zero
          value when in FIPS mode. You cannot expect it to be '1'.

* Defensive coding around some XML activities that are triggered by web
  applications and are therefore at potential risk of a memory leak.
