RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:


PATCHES ACCEPTED TO BACKPORT:
  [ start all new proposals below, under PATCHES PROPOSED. ]

PATCHES PROPOSED TO BACKPORT:
  [ New proposals should be added at the end of the list ]

* Add StuckThreadDetectionValve
  https://github.com/sylvainlaurent/tomcat60/commit/252334f958877221ecb2dc64ee0fd12bb77e360b
  +1: slaurent
  +1: kkolinko: several comments are below
  -1:
  kkolinko: To view/download this as a patch file you add ".diff" to the URL above. That is:
  https://github.com/sylvainlaurent/tomcat60/commit/252334f958877221ecb2dc64ee0fd12bb77e360b.diff

  kkolinko: Minor glitches:
    - In mbeans-descriptors.xml:
      - There are no properties "asyncSupported", "stateName" in TC6 version of this valve.
    - In valve.xml:
      - s/tomcat log/Tomcat log/ (or Apache Tomcat log)
    - In StuckThreadDetectionValve.java:
      - private classes CompletedStuckThread, MonitoredThread: make them static (r1175897)
      - Use Long.valueOf() and explicit boxing/unboxing (r1138132, r1175897)
      - getStuckThreadIds() returns a list of ids. It might be useful to
        have a similar method that returns Thread.getName() names.

* Fix autodeployment of applications that have configuration errors.
  If autodeployment fails, create DeployedApplication object and register
  what we deployed (xml or war or dir - a single file) as redeployResource.
  If it is updated the application will be redeployed.
  + ContainerBase patch adds display of failed apps in manager. They can be
  listed and undeployed.
  http://people.apache.org/~kkolinko/patches/2011-11-14_tc6_HostConfig.patch
  http://people.apache.org/~kkolinko/patches/2011-11-14_tc6_ContainerBase.patch
  +1: kkolinko
  +0: kfujino: Question of if host.addChild(context) threw IllegalStateException.
      E.g. case of deployDirectory.
      If META-INF/context.xml exist in Directory, context.xml is copied to configBase.
      If host.addChild(context) threw IllegalStateException, only a directory is 
      registered into redeployResources. Context.xml does not register into redeployResources.
      If manager app execute undeploy(or delete directory), directory is deleted 
      but context.xml isn't deleted.
      Should (conf/Catalina/localhost/)context.xml be registered into redeployResources? 
      Or need to delete context.xml manually?

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=52579
  Propose new implementation of ByteChunk.toStringInternal().
  This fix does not reintroduce issue BZ51400.
  This fix avoids http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6196991.
  https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/attachment.cgi?id=28274

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=52500
  Add configurable mechanism to retrieve user names from X509 client certificates.
  trunk patch: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=r1298476
  additional clean-up patches (good for markt?):
     http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=r1298542
     http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=r1298577
     http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=r1298590
     http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=r1298592
  +1: schultz, fhanik
  +1: markt if clean-up is also applied
  +1: kkolinko: with clean-ups (r1298542, r1298577, r1298590, r1298592)
  -1:

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=52723
  Correct theoretical resource leak in StandardManager
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=1299036&view=rev
  +1: markt, fhanik
  +0: kkolinko: no native resources are leaked actually, so I see no need
       to do some work that garbage collector can do as well
  -1:

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=52830
  Lookups using javax.naming.Name fail
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=1298635&view=rev
  +1: markt
  +1: fhanik - would have been easier to read if 90% of the patch wasn't document/formatting related
  +1: kkolinko, though see alternative implementation,
       http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=1304468&view=rev
       (explained in https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=52830#c6 )

* https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=52811
  Fix parsing of Content-Type
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=1300154&view=rev (new HTTP header parser)
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=1300155&view=rev (the actual fix)
  (=r1300157+r1300161 in TC7)
  +1: markt
   0: fhanik - introducing a new parser this late into a release seems too risky for 6
  +1: kkolinko: With followups (in trunk: r1304275,1304895; in 7.0.x: r1304897).
        The fix affects response.contentType parsing only. So I think it is
        acceptable. I'd be more concerned if it affected request.contentType
        processing.
  -1:

* Fix bug https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=52858
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=1300948&view=rev
  +1: fhanik, markt, rjung
  -1:
  rjung: Isn't this only fixing the regression introduced by 52858 (BZ 53138)
  but 52858 will be again unfixed?
  
* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=52918
  Add WebSocket support to Tomcat 6
  +1: fhanik

* Update Apache Commons Daemon to 1.0.10.
  Update the native component of the Tomcat APR/native connector to
  1.1.23 and take advantage of the simplified distribution.
  It is backport of the following revs of 7.0.x:
  r1300557 r1301269 r1305197
  http://people.apache.org/~kkolinko/patches/2012-03-26_tc6_update_deps.patch
  +1: kkolinko, rjung, markt
  -1:

* Backport UserDataHelper class (issue 52184)
  Provide greater control over the logging of errors triggered by invalid
  input data (i.e. data over which Tomcat has no control).

  Note: cookies logging (o.a.t.util.http.Cookies) does not need to be
  addressed in Tomcat 6, because all logging in that class here is done at
  debug level.

  svn cp ../../trunk/java/org/apache/tomcat/util/log/UserDataHelper.java@1242371 java/org/apache/tomcat/util/log/UserDataHelper.java

* Fix several trivial HTML markup errors in example servlets
  e.g. duplicate <body> tag preceding <head> and <tr> following </table>
  http://people.apache.org/~kkolinko/patches/2012-05-13_tc6_sampleservlets.patch
  (backport of revs 1337719 1337734 1337741 1337745)
  +1: kkolinko, rjung, markt
  -1:

* https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=52055#c14
  Correctly reset ChunkedInputFilter.needCRLFParse flag when the filter is
  recycled.
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=1342795&view=rev
  (r1342797 in Tomcat 7)
  +1: kkolinko, markt, kfujino
  -1:

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=53267
  Ensure that using the GC Daemon Protection feature of
  the <code>JreMemoryLeakPreventionListener</code> does not trigger a
  full GC every hour.
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1343895

PATCHES/ISSUES THAT ARE STALLED

* Backport JSP unloading patch (BZ48358).
  The patch has substantially changed since the original version.
  Original revisions are: 937787, 1028377, 1028389, 1028396, 1028861, 1028862, 1028863,
  1028935, 1028939, 1028940, 1028944, 1028950, 1030014, 1030037
  Combined TC 6 patch:
  http://people.apache.org/~rjung/patches/BZ48358-JSP_Unloading-TC6_20101118.patch
  +1: rjung
  -0: markt - http://markmail.org/thread/777be426ulcfmdd3 suggests there may be
              a memory leak in this code somewhere. I'd like to get to the
              bottom of that before porting this
      rjung:  I started a discussion about JSPs and memory on the dev list.
              The updated patch fixes a race condition.
              We can stall this item until we get some feedback about 7.0.5.
      markt - r1172614 needs to be included in this proposal. With that patch,
              my testing shows that the unloading works as designed
