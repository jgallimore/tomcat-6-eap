PATCHES/ISSUES THAT ARE STALLED:

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=44312
  Log an error if there is a conflict between Host and Alias names.
  Improve host management methods in Mapper to avoid occasionally removing
  a wrong host. Check that host management operations are performed on
  the host and not on an alias.

  3) http://svn.apache.org/r1608833
  4) TestMapper changes from http://svn.apache.org/r1608831
  +1: kkolinko, remm, schultz
  -1:
   kkolinko: Good for occasional review, but as backporting r1608833 won't
   be trivial I'd have to update the patch.
   schultz: r1608833 is good, but it does not look like it is absolutely
   required to fix BZ 44312.
