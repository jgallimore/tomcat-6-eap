PATCHES PROPOSED TO BACKPORT:
  [ New proposals should be added at the end of the list ]


* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=45212
  Map.entrySet() should return entries, not values
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=668849&view=rev

* Another fix for https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=43683
  This isn't perfect but it narrows the window for the race condition
  significantly. A perfect fix would require syncing most (all?) of allocate()
  which is on the critical path.

  -0: remm: This cannot be fixed from what you are saying, so this stream of fixes
      seems pointless to me right now

*  Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=36155
   Port the fix from the JK Connector to the AJP and APR Connectors
   http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=672454&view=rev

   -1: remm: No, this gets called all the time, and we're trying to fix a small issue. The real
             solution would be to recycle the fields since as mentioned here it is the cause of 
             the problem (the "local" fields will often never change, but there's no real 
             guarantee overall - it mostly breaks down if there are multiple connectors, with AJP,
             and seems impossible to anticipate):
             https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=36155#c17

* Add Unix support for NSIS (unfortunately, I do not have any Windows computer left, so I need this
  for 6.0.17)

* Fix for https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=45317
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=673487&view=rev
  Properly document and print out the value of the state transfer timeout setting
