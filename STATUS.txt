* Fix issue with Manager app and other apps that use i18n in the UI when a
  request that specifies an Accept-Language of English ahead of French, Spanish
  or Japanese.
  Port all the other improvements to the StringManager from trunk as well

* Better adherence to RFC2616 for content-length headers.
  http://people.apache.org/~markt/patches/2013-09-11-tc6-content-length.patch
  +1: markt
  +0: schultz: I don't see anywhere in RFC2616 that suggests that multiple
               Content-Length headers yields an invalid request. Another option
               for response code in this case might be 411 Length Required.
               There are some conditions under which Content-Type "RFC MUST" be
               ignored, and I don't see those cases in any of the *Processor
               classes.
      markt:   RFC2616 states that multiple headers of the same name may be
               merged in to a single, multi-valued header without any change in
               meaning. Content-Length is clearly defined as a single value
               header. If multiple values are not permitted then neither are
               multiple headers.
  +1: schultz: Changing my vote to +1.

* Add support for limiting the size of chunk extensions when using chunked
  encoding.

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=55749
  Improve the error message when SSLEngine is disabled in AprLifecycleListener
  and SSL is configured for an APR/native connector.

* Add missing J2EE 5 resources
  Note I am generating the patches using git so the patch shows whole new files
  being added. When actually making the commit, they will be copied from 7.0.x 
  and amended to retain history.

* Back-port some XML processing improvements (part 1)
  The patch could have been smaller but I opted to align some of the code with
  Tomcat 7 (which meant re-ordering methods in places) to make it easier to
  compare 6.0.x code with 7.0.x code.

* Back-port some XML processing improvements (part 2)
  JspC passes configuration with ServletContext init params so a real
  implementation is required. This is essentially a back-port of

PATCHES/ISSUES THAT ARE STALLED

* Backport JSP unloading patch (BZ48358).
  The patch has substantially changed since the original version.
  Original revisions are: 937787, 1028377, 1028389, 1028396, 1028861, 1028862, 1028863,
  1028935, 1028939, 1028940, 1028944, 1028950, 1030014, 1030037
  Combined TC 6 patch:
  http://people.apache.org/~rjung/patches/BZ48358-JSP_Unloading-TC6_20101118.patch
  +1: rjung
  -0: markt - http://markmail.org/thread/777be426ulcfmdd3 suggests there may be
              a memory leak in this code somewhere. I'd like to get to the
              bottom of that before porting this
      rjung:  I started a discussion about JSPs and memory on the dev list.
              The updated patch fixes a race condition.
              We can stall this item until we get some feedback about 7.0.5.
      markt - r1172614 needs to be included in this proposal. With that patch,
              my testing shows that the unloading works as designed
      kkolinko - r1428358 (r1428355) is needed - a fix for BZ 54260.
