                         Apache Tomcat 6.0 Patch Proposals
                         =================================


RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:


PATCHES ACCEPTED TO BACKPORT:
  [ start all new proposals below, under PATCHES PROPOSED. ]


PATCHES PROPOSED TO BACKPORT:
  [ New proposals should be added at the end of the list ]

* Fix the maven stuff for the maven repo.
  Before it does't find tomcat-juli.jar and the remoteRepository seems broken .
  http://people.apache.org/~jfclere/patches/maven.patch
  +1: jfclere
  -1: fhanik - easier to pass in the root path (lib/bin) to the macro instead of hacking around it
               if we remove the SCP auto feature, then there should be something to replace it with
               (http://ant.apache.org/manual/OptionalTasks/scp.html)  

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=48545
  Truststores don't have to have passwords
  Based on a patch by 'smmwpf54'
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=910266
  +1: markt
  -1: jfclere: Doc says it should use keystorePass (http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-6.0-doc/config/http.html).
               so that would break existing configurations.
      markt: It shouldn't break existing configs. JSSE allows trust stores to be
             read without providing the password

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=49030
  Failure of one connector should not leave some connectors started and some
  ignored
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=929521&view=rev
  +1: markt
  -1: 
  +0: kkolinko: good, but maybe we should also prevent against starting
    those connectors, that failed to initialize, in StandardService#start()?
    Also the message name (some generic name, "connector.failed"), vs.
    message text ("starting"),  vs. what actually happened (initialize()) -
    I won't insist on fixing that inconsistency.

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=48379
  Make session cookie name, domain and path configurable per context.
  Updated patch in response to review comments from kkolinko & rjung
  http://people.apache.org/~markt/patches/2010-05-18-bug48379.patch
  +1: markt
  -1: 

* Configure Tomcat to use HttpOnly for session cookies by default
  http://people.apache.org/~kkolinko/patches/2010-04-21_tc6_context_httpOnly.patch
  +1: kkolinko
  -0: markt - There wasn't consensus previously.
            - If you are going to change the default, do it in the code
  -1:

* Backport a couple of loader fixes and enhancements:

  Expose properties of VirtualWebappLoader and WebappClassLoader via JMX.
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=936819
  +1: rjung, markt, kkolinko
  -1: 
   kkolinko:
     1) Descriptions should be written on a single line.
        When they are split into several lines it looks nasty in JConsole (JDK 6u20)
     2) Maybe capitalize "uRLs" as "URLs"?
        I tested and either one of these two capitalization variants works correctly.
        Though you need to configure a VirtualWebappLoader to test that:
        without it the property is always a zero-length array.

  Add property "searchExternalFirst" to WebappLoader:
  If set, the external repositories will be searched before
  the WEB-INF ones. Default (false) is unchanged behaviour.
  Also expose the new property via JMX and document it.
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=936823
  http://people.apache.org/~rjung/patches/2010-05-14-loader-backport-r936823.patch
  +1: rjung
  -1: markt - The new block
              if (hasExternalRepositories && searchExternalFirst) {...}
              needs to silently swallow CNFE to have same behaviour as previous
              code

  Expose the new WebappLoader flag in the VirtualWebappLoader,
  but allow alternative name searchVirtualFirst to make it
  consistent with the "virtual" terminology.
  Now you can decide, whether the virtual paths will
  be searched before the webapp or after it.
  If searched before, external resources take precendence
  over internal ones. Before that change one couldn't overwrite
  resources already present in the webapp.

  http://people.apache.org/~rjung/patches/2010-05-14-loader-backport-r936825.patch
  +1: rjung

  Add the new contextName property of WebappClassLoader
  to its toString() and expose as read only via JMX.
