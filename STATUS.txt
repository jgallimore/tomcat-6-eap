* Remove a stale empty test class from tribes tests.
  It does nothing, has no references.

* Align ROOT/index.html and ROOT/index.jsp
  It is backport of r1560857 and followup to r648575 that
  fixed one of the two files.

  The following fixes were part of r648575:
  - Fix broken links if ROOT application is renamed.
  - Merge "Examples" section of menu into "Miscellaneous" one.

  The following fixes are new:
  - Remove dead links to Sun sites.
  - Add link to the Specifications page of Tomcat Wiki.
  - Correct mailing lists links so that they point to the Mailing List
  page on the site, so that people have a chance to read instructions there.
